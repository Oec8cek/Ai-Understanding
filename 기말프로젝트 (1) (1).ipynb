       "['Title: Survey of the Applications of NGS to Whole-Genome Sequencing and Expression Profiling\\n\\nRecently, the technologies of DNA sequence variation and gene expression profiling have been used widely as approaches in the expertise of genome biology and genetics.\\n\\nThe application to genome study has been particularly developed with the introduction of the next-generation DNA sequencer (NGS) Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa systems, along with bioinformation analysis technologies of whole-genome de novo assembly, expression profiling, DNA variation discovery, and genotyping.\\n\\nBoth massive whole-genome shotgun paired-end sequencing and mate paired-end sequencing data are important steps for constructing de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing data.\\n\\nIt is necessary to have DNA sequence information from a multiplatform NGS with at least 2× and 30× depth sequence of genome coverage using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, for effective an way of de novo assembly.\\n\\nMassive short-length reading data from the Illumina/Solexa system is enough to discover DNA variation, resulting in reducing the cost of DNA sequencing.\\n\\nWhole-genome expression profile data are useful to approach genome system biology with quantification of expressed RNAs from a whole-genome transcriptome, depending on the tissue samples.\\n\\nThe hybrid mRNA sequences from Rohce/454 and Illumina/Solexa are more powerful to find novel genes through de novo assembly in any whole-genome sequenced species.\\n\\nThe 20× and 50× coverage of the estimated transcriptome sequences using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, is effective to create novel expressed reference sequences.\\n\\nHowever, only an average 30× coverage of a transcriptome with short read sequences of Illumina/Solexa is enough to check expression quantification, compared to the reference expressed sequence tag sequence.\\n\\nScientists have tried to understand biology through DNA sequence information, since the DNA is verified as the unit of genetic heredity.\\n\\nAlso, scientists hope to dramatically reduce the cost of reading genomic DNA and to obtain the high-throughput DNA sequence information.\\n\\nSince the automated DNA sequencers were developed with fluorescent dyes of different colors, laser, and computer technology in the 1980s, the human genome project (HGP) was begun in 1990, and the human genome was completely released in 2003, while further analysis is still being published.\\n\\nA total of about 3 billion dollars was invested to the project.\\n\\nIn 1991, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funds were geared toward lowering the cost of DNA sequencing.\\n\\nSome of technologies invested improved the DNA sequencing.\\n\\nTo date, the Applied Biosystems, Roche/454, and Illumina/Solexa have successfully developed their technology and applied DNA sequencing in the world during the recent 6 years.\\n\\nMost of the newest technologies currently in use generate sequences from 36 to 1,000 base pairs, which requires special software for different applications, including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and regulatory gene analysis.\\n\\nIn particular, in silico method development using bioinformation software for next-generation sequence assembly would be alert for many genome projects and more applications in genome biology.\\n\\nParticularly, many biologists and geneticists using massive DNA and RNA sequences have used the sequencing applications focused on the variable research fields in medicine, such as improved diagnosis of disease; gene therapy; control systems for drugs, including pharmacogenomics \"custom drugs;\" evolution; bioenergy and environmental applications of creative energy sources (biofuels); clean up of toxic wastes, including efficient environmental sources against carbon; and agriculture projects, including livestock of healthier, more productive, disease-resistant farm animals and breeding of disease-, insect-, and drought-resistant crops.\\n\\nIn this paper, we report several ways of genome sequencing and expression profiling in genome biology.\\n\\nTitle: Roche/454 pyrosequencing technology\\n\\nThe first high-parallel sequencing system was developed with an emulsion PCR method for DNA amplification and an instrument for sequencing by synthesis using a pyrosequencing protocol optimized on the individual well of a PicoTiterPlate (PTP) [1].\\n\\nThe DNA sequencing protocol, including sample preparation, is supplied for a user to follow the method, which is developed by 454 Life Science (now part of Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\\n\\nEven following the manufacturer\\'s protocol, to obtain high-quality DNA sequence with maximal total DNA sequence length as possible, one should make a library with both adapters on the sheared DNA fragment and mix the optical ratio of library DNA versus bead for emulsion PCR.\\n\\nNow, the system is upgraded to through-put a total of an average of 700 Mbp with an average 600 bp/read in one PTP run.\\n\\nThe sequencer is available for single reads and paired-end read sequencing for the application of eukaryotic and prokaryotic whole-genome sequencing [2, 3], metagenomics and microbial diversity [4, 5], and genetic variation detection for comparative genomics [6].\\n\\nTitle: Illumina/Solexa technology\\n\\nThe numerous cost-effective technologies were being developed for human genome resequencing that can be aligned to the reference sequence [7, 8].\\n\\nThe first successful technology to gain massive DNA sequencing available for resequencing was developed by Solexa (now part of Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\\n\\nThe principle of the system is the method of base-by-base sequencing by synthesis, where the sheared template DNA is amplified on the flat surface slide (flow cell) and detects one base on each template per cycle with four base-specific, fluorescently labeled signals.\\n\\nSignals for all four fluorescent channels are collected and plotted at each position, enabling quality per scores to be derived using four-color information if desired [8].\\n\\nNow, a maximum of 300 Gb for reading is available with 101 bp paired-end reading per fragment on a 1-flow cell run in the upgraded HiSeq system.\\n\\nTitle: Novel whole genome de novo assembly\\n\\nMore than 11,000 sequencing projects, including targeted projects, were reported on the Genome Online Database (GOLD, http://www.genomesonline.org) in early 2012.\\n\\nNow, more than 3,000 genome projects have been completed on the diverse genome species, and more than 90% of completed projects were bacterial genome sequencing.\\n\\nThe greatest bacterial genome sequencing was performed with 454 pyrosequencing because of the available largest long read sequencing, useful for de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing.\\n\\nThe official depth of the deep sequencing strategy of 454 pyrosequencing technology for whole bacterial genome sequencing for de novo assembly in novel genome sequencing is at least 15-20× in depth of the estimated genome size [9-13].\\n\\nHowever, Li et al.[3] reported that 6-10× sequencing in qualified runs with 500-bp reads would be enough for de novo assemblies from 1,480 prokaryote genomes with >98% genome coverage, <100 contigs with N50, and size >100 kb.\\n\\nRecently, prokaryote whole genome sequencing using 101 bp paired-end read data from Illumina/Solexa systems was used for de novo assembly and resequencing.\\n\\nFor example, a Bacillus subtilis subspecies genome sequence was generated by using the short read sequence from Illumina/Solexa and assembled with the Velvet program [14].\\n\\nIn this case, the genome assembly was completed, based on the reference genome for ordering the numerous contigs derived from de novo assembly.\\n\\nEven though numerous contigs assembled with Illumina/Solexa data were produced in the eukaryotic genome, a few drafts for the assembled genome sequence were reported, except for the giant panda genome [15], which was covered with assembled contigs (2.25 Gb), covering approximately 94% of the expected whole genome.\\n\\nAnother example was the woodland strawberry genome (240 Mb) [16] that was sequenced to 39× depth of the genome, assembled de novo, and anchored to the linkage map of seven pseudochromosomes.\\n\\nThe genome sequence could be associated with the predicted genes with transcriptome sequence data.\\n\\nAn ideal method for cost-effective novel genome sequencing using NGS is de novo assembly with diverse shotgun fragment end sequencing data of multiplat systems (Fig.1).\\n\\nThe first strategy of novel genome DNA sequencing is sequencing the genomic DNA for contig and scaffold construction after randomly sheared shotgun single read-end or paired-end read DNA sequencing using Roche/454 or Illumina/Solexa with information on how to assemble with the NGS data using variable assembly software.\\n\\nRecently, a catfish genome was sequenced with multiplatform Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa technology and assembled with an effective combination of low coverage depth of 18× Roche/454 and 70× Illumina/Solexa data using 3 assembly softwares - Newbler software to the 454 reads, Velvet assembler to the Illumina read, and MIRA assembler for final assembly of contigs and singletons derived from initial assembled data - resulting in 193 contigs with an N50 value of 13,123 bp [2].\\n\\nIn an additional multiplatform data assembly of a 40-Mb eukaryotic genome of the fungus Sordaria macrospra, a combination sequence of 85-fold coverage of Illumina/Solexa and 10-fold coverage by Roche/454 sequencing was assembled to a 40-Mb draft version (N50 of 117 kb) with the Velvet assembler as a reference of a model organism for fungal morphogenesis [17].\\n\\nIn the recent effective assembly methods reported, combinations of the multiplatform sequence are shown as successful novel genome assembly using variable assembly strategy pipelines.\\n\\nComparing the pipeline of assembly strategy, we suggest an effective integrated pipeline in which data are filtered to remove low-quality and short-read initial assemblies using variable software and then compared to contigs, hybrid contigs using MIRA assembler, and finally contig orders using SSPACE software (http://www.baseclear.com/dna-sequencing/data-analysis/) [18] for scaffold construction through de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing (Fig.2).\\n\\nAccording to the comparison of several ways of de novo assembly, we suggest using both DNA sequences from multiplatform NGS with at least 2× and 30× depth sequences of genome coverage using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, and doing hybrid assembly for cost-effective novel genome sequencing.\\n\\nTitle: SNP discovery and genotyping with resequencing\\n\\nResequencing of genomic regions or target genes of interest in a phenotype is the first step in the detection of DNA variations associated with the gene regulation.\\n\\nThe discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including insertion/deletions (indels), with high-throughput data is useful to study genetic variation, comparative genomics, linkage map, and genomic selection for breeding value with DNA variation.\\n\\nMany geneticists for biological and genome studies of microbial, plant, animal, and human genomes have effectively used NGS whole-genome resequencing data to use in variable research fields, such as bacterial evolution [19], genomewide analysis of mutagenesis of Escherichia coli strains [20], comparative genomics of Streptococcus suis of swine pathogen [21], genomic variation effects on phenotype and gene regulation in mouse [22], evolution of plant [23], and comparison of genetic variations on the targeted enrichment [24].\\n\\nThe platforms of resequencing projects have used Illumina/Solexa of short read lengths to align with the reference sequence to discover DNA variations between compared related species\\' sequences.\\n\\nBecause of rare occurrence of SNPs in most species, it is important to identify high-accuracy data to discover DNA variations according to coverage depth using MAQ (http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml) [25] and CLC software (http://www.clcbio.com).\\n\\nThe public protocol of covering depth to discover SNPs and indels on the heterogeneous genome requires at least 30× of the reference genome, while about 10× depth of coverage is enough for DNA variation study of homogeneous genomes.\\n\\nOf course, high coverage of depth provides high-quality data in SNP detection on the reference mapping (Fig.3).\\n\\nHowever, short read lengths of 35 bp or 100 bp show enough to map on the reference sequence using the MAQ software and CLC software in the genome, including short repeated block regions.\\n\\nBut, geneticists still require long-read sequencing data to distinguish repeated block regions, like paralogous regions derived from gene duplication.\\n\\nMAQ software provides a consensus sequence of the genotype sequenced of short read lengths with aligned raw reads to the reference sequence.\\n\\nCLC software checks accuracy by counting reads of DNA variations of each position.\\n\\nRecently, a novel application of pattern recognition for accurate DNA variations was discovered in the complexity of the genomic region using high-throughput data in a Caucasian population [26].\\n\\nThey used three independent datasets with Sanger sequencing and Affymetrix and Illumina microarrays to validate SNPs and indels of a clinical target region, FKBP5.\\n\\nTherefore, it is necessary for multiplatform systems to validate DNA variations in the specific complexity of the genome region.\\n\\nTitle: Expression profiling\\n\\nGene expression profiling is a measurement of the regulation of a transcriptome from the whole genome in the field of molecular biology.\\n\\nA conventional method to measure the relative activity of target genes is DNA microarray technology, which estimates expressed genes with the signals of hybridization of target genes (cDNA from mRNA) on the synthesized oligonucleotides [27].\\n\\nThe technology is still used for functional genomics in the wide era, including medicine, clinic, plant, and agricultural biotechnology [28-30].\\n\\nIn addition, microarray technology is also used in the comparative study of proteomics and expression, measuring the level of extracellular matrix protein [30].\\n\\nSince NGS technology was developed in 2005, the transcriptome of novel whole genomes could be identified with massive parallel mRNA sequencing using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa [31-36].\\n\\nThe Roche/454 system is more useful for gaining novel gene discovery of novel species\\' genomes for long read sequencing [37, 38].\\n\\nOtherwise, Illumina/Solexa is being used to profile the expression of known genes with mapping short read sequences to the known reference genes [39, 40].\\n\\nIn that case, rare expressed genes and novel genes could be identified with high-throughput expressed sequence tag sequences using Illumina/Solexa.\\n\\nAlso, it is useful to find significant tissue-specific expression biases with comparison of transcript data [22].\\n\\nNow, the hybrid mRNA sequence from Rohce/454 and Illumina/Solexa is more powerful for finding novel genes through de novo assembly in any whole-genome species.\\n\\nThe hybrid sequence data of 20× and 50× coverage of the estimated transcriptome sequence from Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, is effective in creating novel expressed reference sequences, while short-read Illumina/Solexa data are cost-efficient on expression quantification information for comparing exposed samples and natural phenotype samples through mapping to the reference genes (Fig.4).\\n\\nOnly and average 30× coverage of transcriptome depth of short-read sequences of Illumina/Solexa is enough to check expression quantification, compared to reference expressed sequence tag sequences.\\n\\nThe expressed information could be different, depending on the software using CAP3, MIRA, Newbler, SeqMan, and CLC.\\n\\nTherefore, the results should be compared according to variable program options to define robust expression profiling [41].\\n\\nTo date, a powerful tool of ChIP-on-chip is used for understanding gene transcription regulation.\\n\\nThus, two-channel microarray technology of a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation could be used for genomewide mapping of binding sites of DNA-interacting proteins [29].\\n\\nIn any NGS application, the transcriptome expression information would be more useful than complete genome information research with the lowest sequencing budget for biologists to better understand gene regulation of related genetic phenotypes with the in silico method.\\n\\nOf in silico methods, conserved miRNA and novel miRNA discovery is available on the massive miRNAnome data in any species.\\n\\nSpecially, the target genes of miRNA discovered could be robust information to approach genome biology studies.\\n\\nTranscriptome assembly is smaller than genome assembly and thus should be more computationally tractable but is often harder, as individual contigs can often have highly variable read coverages.\\n\\nComparing single assemblers, Newbler 2.5 performed the best on our trial dataset, but other assemblers were closely comparable.\\n\\nCombining different optimal assemblies from different programs, however, gives a more credible final product, and this strategy is recommended [41].\\n\\nNGS technology provides a cost-effective way of sequencing for novel whole-genome sequencing, resequencing, and expression profiling.\\n\\nRohce/454 pyrosequencing is recommended to de novo assembly of whole prokaryote novel genomes, while hybrid assembly with Illumina/Solexa sequences would be optimal for whole eukaryote genomes and transcriptome studies of non-model organisms.\\n\\nAlso, Illumina/Solexa sequencing is useful in detecting DNA variation, mapping the short-read resequence to the reference genome and profiling expressed genes in model organisms.\\n\\nFurthermore, the high-throughput NGS sequencing enables us to study with an in silico method in variable research application fields of molecular genetics, including population diversity and comparative genomics, in a short time.\\n\\nStringency of whole-genome DNA shotgun sequencing for novel genome.\\n\\nWhole-genome shotgun sequencing (left of the Figure) for contig construction: Sequencing of single-end or paired-end fragment of whole-genome DNA shotgun library, which are made with the average range of 200-800-bp fragments for Roche/454

       " \"Title: Differential Expression of PKD2-Associated Genes in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\\n\\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts that expand over time and destroy renal architecture.\\n\\nThe proteins encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, mutations in which account for nearly all cases of ADPKD, may help guard against cystogenesis.\\n\\nPreviously developed mouse models of PKD1 and PKD2 demonstrated an embryonic lethal phenotype and massive cyst formation in the kidney, indicating that PKD1 and PKD2 probably play important roles during normal renal tubular development.\\n\\nHowever, their precise role in development and the cellular mechanisms of cyst formation induced by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations are not fully understood.\\n\\nTo address this question, we presently created Pkd2 knockout and PKD2 transgenic mouse embryo fibroblasts.\\n\\nWe used a mouse oligonucleotide microarray to identify messenger RNAs whose expression was altered by the overexpression of the PKD2 or knockout of the Pkd2.\\n\\nThe majority of identified mutations was involved in critical biological processes, such as metabolism, transcription, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and signal transduction.\\n\\nHerein, we confirmed differential expressions of several genes including aquaporin-1, according to different PKD2 expression levels in ADPKD mouse models, through microarray analysis.\\n\\nThese data may be helpful in PKD2-related mechanisms of ADPKD pathogenesis.\\n\\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenetic disorder, affecting as many as 1 in 500 people in the general population.\\n\\nThe disease is characterized by the formation of multiple fluid-filled renal cysts that expand over time and destroy the architecture of the kidney.\\n\\nFive percent of all cases of chronic renal failure are due to ADPKD, and approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal disease by the time they are 60 years of age [1].\\n\\nIn the early stages of ADPKD, numerous cysts begin to enlarge from many segments of the kidney.\\n\\nLater, the enlarged regions disassociate from the original nephron to form the actual cysts, which continue to enlarge due to proliferation of epithelial cells and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen.\\n\\nProgressive renal cyst formation and enlargement result in a loss of renal function and hypertension and culminate in renal failure.\\n\\nIt is generally believed that cysts enlarge by means of abnormal cell growth, forming what is essentially a fluid-filled tumor that fills by transepithelial fluid secretion.\\n\\nCyst enlargement may then lead to extracellular matrix remodeling, interstitial fibrosis, a general inflammatory response, and disruption of the normal renal parenchyma, which then interfere with glomerular filtration and vascular blood flow, giving rise to cell death by apoptosis and ultimately renal failure [2].\\n\\nMany studies have indicated that most cases of ADPKD are accounted for by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding the transmembrane protein polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively.\\n\\nMice with targeted mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes develop cystic kidneys during embryogenesis, and ADPKD in humans is associated with mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes [3, 4].\\n\\nIn addition, the product of the PKD1 gene, PC1, has been implicated in a variety of pathways tied to proliferation, including G-protein signaling and the Wnt, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription cascades [5, 6].\\n\\nMoreover, depletion of PC1 has been shown to increase cell growth, whereas its overexpression slows cell growth, indicating that PC1 may negatively regulate cell proliferation [7, 8].\\n\\nPC2, the protein product of PKD2, has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation via its calcium channel activity and stimulation of AP-1 [9, 10]; however, there has been little direct evidence tying PC2 to this process.\\n\\nHere, we created a number of related cell lines that varied in their expression of PC2.\\n\\nWe describe studies designed to identify target genes under the control of the PKD2 using Pkd2 knockout (KO) and PKD2 transgenic (TG) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs).\\n\\nWe used a mouse 30 K whole gene oligonucleotide microarray to identify messenger RNAs whose expression was altered by the overexpression of the PKD2 or KO of the Pkd2 in MEF cells.\\n\\nTitle: Establishment of MEF derived from wild-type and PKD2 mutation embryos\\n\\nMEF were acquired from PKD2 TG embryos or Pkd2 KO embryos during development (13.5 days) [11].\\n\\nHeads and limes were removed from embryos.\\n\\nThe remaining embryonic tissues were minced and dispersed in 0.05% trypsin prior to incubation at 37℃ for 15 min.\\n\\nCells were plated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium of Defined Minimal Essential medium (Welgene Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Welgene Biotech) and were cultured at 37℃ in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 until confluent growth was achieved.\\n\\nMEF cells were frozen as stocks at the second passage and were used for the subsequent studies at the third passage.\\n\\nTitle: Microrray hybridization and data analysis\\n\\nTotal RNA was prepared using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Valancia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\\n\\nGene expression profiles were obtained using the CodeLink Uniset Mouse Expression Bioarray (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).\\n\\nThe 30,000 gene probes contained in the bioarray allows the detection of differences in gene expression as low as 1.3-fold with 95% confidence.\\n\\nTen micrograms of total RNA was amplified, and labeled cDNA was produced.\\n\\nBiotin-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the array overnight in a shaking incubator at 37℃, and excess target sequences were washed away using a series of saline sodium citrate washes.\\n\\nThe array was stained by treatment with streptavidin-Alexaflour 647 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), the excess was washed away, and the array was scanned at an excitation wavelength of 632 nm using a GenePix scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\\n\\nThe resulting image was quantified, and the intensity of each spot was divided by the median spot intensity to provide a scaled and comparable number across multiple arrays.\\n\\nTitle: DNA microarray scanning and analysis\\n\\nMicroarrays were scanned using an Arraywox scanner (Applied Precision, Seattle, WA, USA), analyzed using ImaGene version 5.1 software (Biodiscovery, Segundo, CA, USA), and normalized using Genesight version 3.2 software (Biodiscovery).\\n\\nNormalization was performed by subtracting the means of all genes.\\n\\nThe data normalized by Genesight were compared using an M/A plot.\\n\\nGenes differentially expressed were identified by intensity differences, after subtracting the background intensity.\\n\\nGenes showing expression changes of at least 2-fold were selected, and these selected genes were clustered by the hierarchical method.\\n\\nTitle: Clustering algorithm\\n\\nThe normalized log ratio corresponding to each time point was exported to the software for clustering algorithm.\\n\\nAcuity version 3.1 (Molecular Devices) was used for the 'gene shaving' algorithm.\\n\\nTo estimate the number of clusters in a dataset, the 'Gap Statistics' attribute of the Acuity software package was used.\\n\\nThe cluster number, estimated by gap statistics, was used for an input parameter in gene shaving.\\n\\nAfter gene shaving, a single linkage was used for hierarchical clustering.\\n\\nTitle: Semi-quantitative and real-time RT-PCR\\n\\nTotal RNA was prepared using a commercial kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\\n\\nSingle-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubating 5 µg total RNA with 200 units AMV, 100 nM oligo(dT)12-18, 1 mM dNTP mixture, and 40 units RNase inhibitor at 42℃ for 1 h in a final volume of 25 µL.\\n\\nThe reaction was terminated by incubation at 70℃ for 15 min.\\n\\nThe initial amount of mRNA and reaction conditions were optimized to obtain linearity for mouse 18s rRNA.\\n\\nFor semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, the used primers were: human PKD2, forward 5'-CGTGCCCCAGCCCAGTC-3' and reverse 5'-TTCCAGTACAGCCCATCCAATAAG-3'; mouse Pkd2, forward 5'-TGCGAGGGCTGCGAGGTC-3' and reverse 5'-TGTCAGCTTGCGTGTGGTTGC-3'; mouse 18s rRNA, forward 5'-GTAACCCGTTGCACCCCATT-3' and reverse 5'-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3'.\\n\\nRT-PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95℃, 25 cycles of 50 s at 94℃, 50 s at 57℃, 50 s at 72℃, and 5 min at 72℃.\\n\\nThe amplified products were separated on a 1% agarose gel.\\n\\nFor real-time PCR, the used primers were: mouse β-actin, (forward 5'-GACGATGCTCCCCGGGCTGTATTC-3' and reverse 5'-TCTCTTGCTCTGGGCCTCGTCACC-3') used as a positive control; mouse peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), forward 5'-TCTTAACTGCCGGATCCACAAAAA-3' and reverse 5'-ATCTCCGCCAACAGCTTCTCCTTC-3'; mouse protein kinase α (PKCα), forward 5'-GGGCAGCCTCCGTTTGATGGT-3' and reverse 5'-CGCTTGGCAGGGTGTTTGGTC-3'; mouse

transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2), forward 5'-TCATCCCGAATAAAAGCGAAGAGC-3' and reverse 5'-AGGGCAACAACATTAGCAGGAGAT-3'.\\n\\nReal-time RT-PCR was performed using the real-time SensiMixPlus SYBR kit as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Quantance, London, UK).\\n\\nTitle: Western blot analysis\\n\\nProteins were extracted using radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer in MEF cells.\\n\\nProteins were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Bellerica, MA, USA).\\n\\nMembranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and were incubated with various antibodies.\\n\\nAntibodies to PC2 (anti-human and anti-mouse) and AQP1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).\\n\\nAntibodies to β-actin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\\n\\nAnti-Wnt4 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).\\n\\nEach membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween, and immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).\\n\\nTitle: Confirmation of PKD2 expression in Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEFs\\n\\nMouse Pkd2 mRNA was revealed in KO wild-type (KOWT) MEF cells but not in KO MEF cells.\\n\\nAlso, Pkd2 mRNA was expressed in TG wild-type (TGWT) MEF cells and PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nHuman PKD2 mRNA was only expressed in PKD2 TG MEF cells obtained from PKD2 TG embryos following injection of the human PKD2 transgene (Fig.1A).\\n\\nConsistently, the expression level of polycystin-2 was lower in KO MEFs than KOWT MEFs as well as higher in TG MEFs than TGWT MEFs (Fig.1B).\\n\\nTitle: Microarray gene expression analysis\\n\\nWe used a mouse 30 K whole gene oligonucleotide microarray to identify mRNAs whose expression was altered by the Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nThe normalized log ratios corresponding to each time point were exported to the software for clustering algorithm.\\n\\nWe used Axon's Acuity 3.1 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA) for using the 'gene shaving' algorithm.\\n\\nTo estimate the number of clusters in a dataset, we used 'Gap Statistics' in Acuity 3.1.\\n\\nThe cluster number estimated by gap statistics was used for an input parameter in gene shaving.\\n\\nAfter gene shaving, we used a single linkage hierarchical clustering.\\n\\nThe single linkage hierarchical clustering method divides 8 'gene shaving' clusters (Fig.2).\\n\\nThe majority of genes whose expression was appreciably altered encoded proteins involved in critical biological processes, such as metabolism, transcription, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and signal transcription.\\n\\nForty-five genes whose expression was changed by 2-fold or greater were identified (Table 1).\\n\\nTitle: Verification of candidate genes by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis\\n\\nTo verify the results obtained by cDNA microarray analysis, expression patterns for selected genes were confirmed at the RNA and protein levels.\\n\\nWe selected seven genes among the 45 genes (Fig.3A).\\n\\nAs result of realtime RT-PCR, the expression patterns of PKCα, ITGα4, and AQP1 were identical to microarray analysis in Pkd2 KO MEF cells (Fig.3B).\\n\\nIn contrast, 6 genes, except for TGF-β2, were identically expressed in PKD2 TG MEF cells (Fig.3C).\\n\\nEspecially, the AQP1 gene may be significantly regulated by differential Pkd2 gene expression level.\\n\\nFurthermore, to confirm the AQP1 protein expression level, western blot analysis was performed using MEF cells as well as kidney tissues obtained from Pkd2 KO (or heterozygote) and PKD2 TG mice.\\n\\nAs result, AQP1 protein level was consistent with mRNA levels in both MEFs and tissues (Fig.4).\\n\\nAlthough remarkable progress toward understanding the genetics and pathophysiology of ADPKD has been made to date, it is still unclear how mutations in disease-causing genes trigger cystogenesis and what important role other molecules play in the cystic phenotype [12].\\n\\nOur aim here was to identify genes associated with the cystic phenotype using Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nIn a previous study, overexpression of human PKD2 led to anomalies in tubular function, due to abnormalities in tubule morphogenesis [13].\\n\\nSimilar findings have been made for the PKD1 gene.\\n\\nFor this gene, gain/loss of function and haploinsufficiency leads to cystogenesis, with the severity of the phenotype being related to the level of imbalance.\\n\\nMore severe phenotypes are seen for gain and loss of function than for haploinsufficiency [4].\\n\\nIn the present study, the association between cystogenesis and the loss or gain of PKD2 supports the idea that PC2 functions through Pkd2 mutant MEF cells.\\n\\nPresently, we found Wnt4 to be up-regulated in Pkd2 KO MEF cells and down-regulated in PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nWnt4, a member of the Wnt family of lipid-modified secreted glycoproteins, plays central roles in the initial stages of the tubulogenic program.\\n\\nWnt4 is expressed in the pretubular aggregate, as one of the first molecular responses to inductive signaling mediated by ureteric epithelium [14].\\n\\nAQP1 was observed to be up-regulated in both Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nAQP1 is a channel-forming integral membrane protein found in erythrocytes and water-transporting tissues, including the kidney, where it is localized to the proximal tubules and thin descending limbs of Henle's loop.\\n\\nThe selective expression pattern of AQP1 in human nephrogenesis suggests that proximal tubules and thin descending limbs become permeable to water early in development.\\n\\nA predominantly apical expression of AQP1 is found during a critical period of the nephrogenesis, during formation of the proximal tubule, as well as in the early stage of ADPKD; in normal tubules, distribution is both apical and basolateral [15].\\n\\nAnother interesting defect in urine-concentrating ability was described in the Aqp1 knockout mouse.\\n\\nAlthough these mice were grossly normal in terms of survival and appearance, they were vulnerable to water deprivation and became severely dehydrated.\\n\\nThese results suggest that AQP1 is required for the formation of concentrated urine [16].\\n\\nWe have found PKC-α and Bcl-2 associated transcription factor to be down-regulated in Pkd2 KO MEF cells and up-regulated in PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nRecent observations in animal models of PKD have implicated apoptosis in its pathogenesis.\\n\\nPKC- and Erk-dependent pathways are critical components of the cell survival by suppressing the apoptosis [17].\\n\\nWe also have demonstrated the role for PKD2 in cellular adhesion processes.\\n\\nIn this study, ITGα4 was up-regulated in Pkd2 KO MEF cells and down-regulated in PKD2 TG MEF cells.\\n\\nIt suggests that adhesion molecule such as ITGα4 may be associated with PKD2 mutation-related pathogenesis.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by using the cDNA microarray technique, we have found several candidate genes that may be involved in cystogenesis: PKCα, ITGα4 and AQP1.\\n\\nThese genes were affected by PKD2 expression and may be related to cyst formation of kidney together with the PKD2 gene.\\n\\nEstablishment of Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEFs.\\n\\n(A) Semi-quantitative reverse

       " \"Title: Possibility of the Use of Public Microarray Database for Identifying Significant Genes Associated with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma\\n\\nThere are lots of studies attempting to identify the expression changes in oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\nMost studies include insufficient samples to apply statistical methods for detecting significant gene sets.\\n\\nThis study combined two small microarray datasets from a public database and identified significant genes associated with the progress of oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\nThere were different expression scales between the two datasets, even though these datasets were generated under the same platforms - Affymetrix U133A gene chips.\\n\\nWe discretized gene expressions of the two datasets by adjusting the differences between the datasets for detecting the more reliable information.\\n\\nFrom the combination of the two datasets, we detected 51 significant genes that were upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\nMost of them were published in previous studies as cancer-related genes.\\n\\nFrom these selected genes, significant genetic pathways associated with expression changes were identified.\\n\\nBy combining several datasets from the public database, sufficient samples can be obtained for detecting reliable information.\\n\\nMost of the selected genes were known as cancer-related genes, including oral squamous cell carcinoma.\\n\\nSeveral unknown genes can be biologically evaluated in further studies.\\n\\nDespite recent advances in surgical, radiation, and chemotherapeutic treatment protocols, the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains mournful, with an approximate 50% 5-year mortality rate from disease or associated complications [1].\\n\\nTherefore, the identification of biological markers is essential to make progress in detecting malignancy at an early stage and developing novel therapies [2].\\n\\nMicroarray datasets that are created for the same research purposes in different laboratories have accumulated rapidly.\\n\\nThe results from different datasets are often inconsistent due to the utilization of different platforms, sample preparations, or various technical variations.\\n\\nIf we could combine such datasets by adjusting for systematic biases that exist among different datasets derived from different experimental conditions, the power of statistical tests would be improved by the increase in sample size [3].\\n\\nIn OSCC, although lots of microarray-based studies have been conducted to provide insights into gene expression changes, most of these studies have contained insufficient samples for detecting reliable information using statistical analysis [4, 5].\\n\\nTherefore, this study attempted to combine several datasets in the public database for detecting significant genes.\\n\\nWe used two small microarray datasets of OSCC for this study, which were based on the same platform but had different expression scales.\\n\\nThese two datasets were combined after discretization, because a previous study showed that classification could be improved using combined datasets after discretization [3].\\n\\nAfter combining datasets, we used chi-square test for identifying the significant genes.\\n\\nChi-square test has been used commonly to detect differentially expressed genes after discretization of expression intensities in the microarray experiment.\\n\\nIn this study, gene expression ratios of two datasets were transformed with their ranks for each dataset.\\n\\nNext, the transformed datasets were combined, and a nonparametric statistical method was applied to the combined dataset to detect informative genes.\\n\\nFinally, we showed that most of the selected genes were known to be involved in various cancers, including OSCC.\\n\\nTitle: Dataset\\n\\nTwo microarray datasets were used for this study.\\n\\nWe acquired these datasets from a public database (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO).\\n\\nOne was the expression dataset of 16 tumors and 4 normal tissues from 16 patients, using Affymetrix U133A gene chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\\n\\nThe other microarray dataset consisted of expression profiles of 22 tumors and 5 normal tissues.\\n\\nThese two datasets were experimented on under the same platform, Affymetrix U133A.\\n\\nThe datasets are summarized in Table 1.\\n\\nTitle: Process for combining datasets\\n\\nTitle: For combining datasets, gene expression ratios are rearranged in order of expression ratios by each gene in each dataset, and the ranks are matched with the corresponding experimental group.\\n\\nIf the experimental groups are homogenous, the ranks within the same experimental group would be neighboring.\\n\\nThe process of discretization of gene expressions is summarized in the following steps [3]:\\n\\nRank the gene expression ratios within a gene for each dataset.\\n\\nList in order of the ranks, and assign the order of gene expressions to the corresponding experimental groups.\\n\\nSummarize the result of (2) in the form of a contingency table for each gene.\\n\\nCombine the contingency tables that have been summarized for each dataset.\\n\\nWhen there are three datasets to be combined, the datasets can be added as a single entry, as shown in Table 2, after the transformation of each dataset by rank.\\n\\nTitle: Identification of significant genes from a combined dataset\\n\\nTitle: After the summarization of gene expression ratios in the form of a contingency table for each gene, as shown in Table 3, a nonparametric statistical method was applied to the datasets for independence testing between gene expression patterns and experimental groups.\\n\\nThe test statistics are calculated as follows for each gene:\\n\\nWhen the sample size is small - generally Ê(nij) less than 5 - Fisher's exact test is recommended rather than chi-square test.\\n\\nThe significant genes can be selected by an independence test between the phenotypes and gene expressions using this type of summarized dataset.\\n\\nci and ri represent the marginal sums of the ith column and row, respectively.\\n\\nnij is the number of experiments belonging to Ei and Pj, and n represents the total number of experiments.\\n\\nThe clinical information and expression levels of two datasets are summarized in Table 4 and Fig.1.\\n\\nSubgroup and sex were similarly distributed in the two datasets.\\n\\nThe distributions of other factors were not included.The scale of expression levels in the two datasets was different; the expression values of Data 2004 ranged from 0.01 to 740, and those of Data 2005 were from 0.1 to 19,773.\\n\\nThe expression patterns of the two datasets can be explored in Fig.1.Lots of outliers are shown in Fig.1A in the two datasets containing whole gene sets.\\n\\nHowever, in subsets of significant genes, the expression ranges got narrow, and the outliers were decreased (Fig.1B).\\n\\nThe expressions of tumor tissues in Data 2004 were upregulated and varied compared with normal tissues.\\n\\nIf there was no outlier with a maximum value in the 14th tumor tissue in Data 2004, the expressions of the two different groups would be clearly distinguished.\\n\\nAny clear differences in expression were not shown between the two groups in Data 2005.\\n\\nTitle: Upregulated 51 genes in oral squamous cell carcinoma\\n\\nTo identify differently expressed genes between normal and tumor tissues, we performed chi-square test using a combined microarray dataset.\\n\\nFifty-one significant genes were selected from a combined dataset with p-value less than 0.005, which were upregulated in OSCC tissues.\\n\\nThe significance level can be controlled, and more genes can be selected with a lower significance level.\\n\\nThese selected genes are summarized in Table 5.\\n\\nMany genes among the selected genes were known as cancer-related genes.\\n\\nSTAT1 [6], SKP2 [7], IFI16 [8], RHEB [9], FIF44 [10], SOD2 [11, 12], and GREM1 [11] are related to OSCC.\\n\\nTable 6 [13-56] summarizes the previous studies that have published the relations of selected genes with cancer.\\n\\nTitle: Expression pattern of the identified genes\\n\\nTo investigate whether the different experimental groups could be classified with significant genes, an unsupervised hierarchical clustering method was applied to the significant gene set (Fig.2).\\n\\nThe normal group consisted of 4 tissues and showed significantly lower expression levels when compared with the tumor group.\\n\\nIn Fig.2, we investigated the classification availability of the identified genes in Data 2004, not in a combined dataset, because the two datasets have different expression scales.\\n\\nTitle: Network analysis\\n\\nBased on all identified genes, new and expanded pathway maps and connections and specific gene-gene interactions were inferred, functionally analyzed, and used to build on the existing pathway using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) knowledge base [57].\\n\\nTo generate networks in this work, the knowledge base was queried for interactions between the identified genes and all other genes stored in the database.\\n\\nFour networks were found to be significant in OSCC.\\n\\nThe network with the highest score (Network 1, score = 36) was generated, with 17 identified genes (Table 7, Fig.3).\\n\\nIn the network diagram, STAT1 and SOD2 neighbored with NMI and AURKA, respectively.\\n\\nThe expression levels of STAT1 and SOD2 could be expected to be related with those of NMI and SOD2.\\n\\nActually, the expressions of STAT1 and SOD2 were strongly positively correlated with NMI (r = 0.95) and AURKA (r = 0.87), respectively.\\n\\nOSCC is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity [58].\\n\\nTo identify potential biomarkers for early detection of invasive OSCC, microarray experiments have been conducted, and these kinds of microarray datasets have accumulated rapidly in the public database.\\n\\nHowever, there are many datasets that include insufficient sample sizes for detecting significant genes by statistical analysis.\\n\\nTherefore, this study attempted to combine several microarray datasets from a public database to identify significant candidates as biomarkers.\\n\\nIn a microarray data analysis, the information from different datasets obtained under different experimental conditions may be inconsistent even though they are performed with the same research objectives.\\n\\nMoreover, even when the datasets are generated by the same platform, the data agreement may be affected by technical variations between laboratories.\\n\\nIn such cases, it could be necessary to use a combined dataset after adjusting for the differences between such datasets for detecting the more reliable information.\\n\\nCombining datasets is especially useful in OSCC microarray datasets, because there are many datasets with insufficient sample sizes for analysis [4, 5, 59, 60].\\n\\nFor identifying significant genes classifying tumor and normal groups, we achieved two microarray datasets from a public database, GEO.\\n\\nThey included 20 and 27 samples, and each sample size was unbalanced between the different groups.\\n\\nBy combining these two datasets, the sample size was increased, and we had a sufficient sample size for statistical analysis, even though it was still unbalanced.\\n\\nWhen these datasets were combined, we used the rank of gene expression, because the scale of gene expression was different.\\n\\nIn this study, we identified 51 significant genes from a combined dataset, and this number could be increased or decreased by the significance level (we used 0.005).\\n\\nThe selected 51 genes were upregulated in tumor tissues.\\n\\nMany of the selected genes were proven to be cancer-related genes by previous studies.\\n\\nSOD2 is associated with lymph node metastasis in OSCC and may provide predictive values for the diagnosis of metastasis [10].\\n\\nMetastasis is a critical event in OSCC progression.\\n\\nAn SOD2 variant has also been associated with increased breast cancer and ovarian cancer risk in previous studies [47, 61].\\n\\nTopBP1 included eight BRCT domains (originally identified in BRCA1), and it was proposed as a breast cancer susceptibility gene [18, 62].\\n\\nBy semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis, RHEB was shown to be upregulated in OSCC [9].\\n\\nIn salivary cancer, survival probability rates dropped when Skp2 was overexpressed [7].\\n\\nOverexpression of Skp2 is associated with the reduction of p27 (KIP1) expression and may have a role in the progression of OSCC [25].\\n\\nThe expression of RCN2 was linearly related to the tumor mass increase, and its expression was increased in breast cancer [16].\\n\\nPTPRK was proven as a candidate gene of colorectal cancer [19], and it is a functional tumor suppressor in Hodgkin lymphoma cells [20].\\n\\nDMTF1 was shown to be amplified in adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, residing at 7q21 by aCGH experiments [21].\\n\\nFEZ1 was involved in ovarian carcinogenesis, and its reduction or loss could be an aid to the clinical management of patients affected by ovarian carcinoma [22].\\n\\nIt is also a known tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer and gastric cancer [23, 63].\\n\\nOther ovarian cancer-related genes were NMI [27, 28] and FANCI [44]; breast cancer-related genes were COX11 [42], MELK [33], and FANCI [44] among the selected genes.\\n\\nMELK was known to be associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma [34].\\n\\nTTK was associated with progression and metastasis of advanced cervical cancers after radiotherapy [29, 30].\\n\\nIt might also be a relevant candidate as a new target in cancer therapy, since it plays relevant roles in mitotic progression and the spindle checkpoint [31, 32].\\n\\nAurora kinase A (AURKA) was associated with skin tumors [36] and colorectal cancer [37, 38].\\n\\nIn previous studies, OSCC-related genes among the selected genes were STAT1 [14], SKP2 [7, 25], IFI16 [8], RHEB [9], IFI44 [64], SOD2 [10-12], and GREM1 [11].\\n\\nThe gene set, which has not been proven as OSCC-related genes until now, could be expected to be possibly proven as OSCC-related genes by biological evaluation.\\n\\nIn this study, we identified significant genes related with OSCC from two microarray datasets in a public database.\\n\\nFor this, we transformed microarray datasets using ranks of gene expressions with different expression scales, even though they were constructed under the same experimental conditions.\\n\\nThis method could be useful when using multiple datasets that are created for the same research purpose, By combining these accumulated datasets, we can detect more reliable information due to the increased sample size.\\n\\nIt saves time and money and avoids

       " \"Title: CaGe: A Web-Based Cancer Gene Annotation System for Cancer Genomics\\n\\nHigh-throughput genomic technologies (HGTs), including next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), microarray, and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), have become effective experimental tools for cancer genomics to identify cancer-associated somatic genomic alterations and genes.\\n\\nThe main hurdle in cancer genomics is to identify the real causative mutations or genes out of many candidates from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis.\\n\\nOne useful approach is to refer to known cancer genes and associated information.\\n\\nThe list of known cancer genes can be used to determine candidates of cancer driver mutations, while cancer gene-related information, including gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and pathways, can be useful for scoring novel candidates.\\n\\nSome cancer gene or mutation databases exist for this purpose, but few specialized tools exist for an automated analysis of a long gene list from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis.\\n\\nThis report presents a new web-accessible bioinformatic tool, called CaGe, a cancer genome annotation system for the assessment of candidates of cancer genes from HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nThe tool provides users with information on cancer-related genes, mutations, pathways, and associated annotations through annotation and browsing functions.\\n\\nWith this tool, researchers can classify their candidate genes from cancer genome studies into either previously reported or novel categories of cancer genes and gain insight into underlying carcinogenic mechanisms through a pathway analysis.\\n\\nWe show the usefulness of CaGe by assessing its performance in annotating somatic mutations from a published small cell lung cancer study.\\n\\nHigh-throughput genomic technologies (HGTs), including next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), microarray, and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), have become effective tools for cancer genomics through various applications.\\n\\nEspecially, the applications of NGS include whole-genome, exome, and transcriptome approaches for searching for a wide range of cancer-specific genomic alterations, such as point mutations, insertions, and deletions; copy number changes; and rearrangements, leading to the development of cancer [1].\\n\\nOne of the hurdles in HGT-based cancer genomics is to identify causative mutations or genes out of many candidates from the analysis.\\n\\nA useful approach is to refer to known cancer genes and associated information [2].\\n\\nThe list of known cancer genes can be used to determine candidates of cancer driver mutations, while cancer gene-related information, such as gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and pathway information, can be useful for scoring novel candidates.\\n\\nSome useful cancer genomic databases for this purpose exist, including Cancer Gene Census (CGC) [3] and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) [4], which have been constructed and managed by the Cancer Genome Project of the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute; and Cancer Gene Index (CGI, http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/projects/cgdcp), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov), and Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP, http://cgap.nci.nih.gov), which are maintained by the National Cancer Institute of the U. S. National Institute of Health and National Human Genome Research Institute.\\n\\nAmong them, COSMIC and CGC are the two most commonly used resources among researchers when checking reported cancer driver mutations.\\n\\nThe COSMIC database stores information on somatic mutations and associated information extracted from the scientific literature, while the CGC database is a catalog of cancer genes with manually screened somatic mutations extracted from the literature.\\n\\nThese cancer genes are annotated with information concerning chromosomal location, tumor types in which mutations are found, classes of mutations that contribute to oncogenesis, and other genetic properties.\\n\\nAlso, CGI is known to be created through an automated linguistic text analysis of millions of MEDLINE abstracts, with manual validation and annotation of the extracted data by expert curators.\\n\\nIt is a high-quality data resource consisting of genes that have been experimentally associated with human cancer diseases and/or pharmacological compounds, the evidence of these associations, and relevant annotations on the data.\\n\\nThus, it can also be a valuable resource to annotate mutation data from cancer genomics studies.\\n\\nCurrently, few specialized tools exist for an automated analysis of a long gene list from HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nWhile previously described cancer genomic information databases can be useful, they are not effective in processing results from NGS-based cancer genomic studies.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there are many functional annotation systems to analyze gene lists derived from high-throughput microarray experiments, including DAVID [5], GoMiner [6], GOstat [7], Onto-express [8], and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [9].\\n\\nDAVID is one of the most popular general purpose functional annotation systems.\\n\\nIt provides various effective analysis tools and is also applicable in the analysis of gene lists from cancer genomics research.\\n\\nHowever, DAVID is not optimized for processing results from HGT-based cancer genomics data, especially for NGS-based cancer genomics downstream data; therefore, a more specialized cancer gene annotation system is needed.\\n\\nHere, we introduce a web-accessible cancer genome annotation system, named CaGe, to provide users with information on cancer genes, mutations, pathways, and associated annotations, based on several cancer gene databases composed of reported cancer-causing genes and associated cancer pathways.\\n\\nFor a given gene list, CaGe searches cancer gene databases with converted standard gene symbols, analyzes the biological pathways, and provides various cancer gene-related annotations through intuitive web user interfaces.\\n\\nIt also serves additional functions, including processing various input types and formats, managing jobs for user submitted tasks, and browsing for cancer genes and pathways with various useful hyperlinks between the annotations and the external public annotation databases.\\n\\nWe hope CaGe will be useful in identifying cancer-causing mutations and genes in HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nThe goal of this study was to provide researchers with a tool for classifying their candidate genes from HGT-based cancer genome studies into previously reported or novel categories of cancer genes, while providing insight into underlying carcinogenic mechanisms through a pathway analysis.\\n\\nTo implement the cancer gene annotation function of CaGe, we constructed reported cancer gene and cancer annotation databases from public cancer genomic databases and cancer pathway-gene databases by pathway analysis with reported cancer gene sets and canonical pathways.\\n\\nWe also constructed a gene ID database to allow various input formats for the input of gene lists and a gene functional annotation database to provide users with functional clues for the annotated candidate genes.\\n\\nThen, we developed a core retrieval program and web interfaces for the main functions, which include cancer gene annotation, cancer pathway annotation, cancer gene browsing, and cancer pathway browsing.\\n\\nThe workflow for the database construction and data processing in CaGe is summarized in Fig.1, and the cancer gene annotation page of the CaGe web interface is shown in Fig.2.\\n\\nTitle: Cancer gene and annotation data\\n\\nTo construct the reported cancer gene database, we used gene sets from the CGC database (released on Dec, 2010) and CGI database (downloaded on Feb, 2011).\\n\\nThe cancer pathways for the cancer pathway gene database construction were assigned based on statistical significance from one-tailed Fisher's exact test for overlapping genes between reported cancer gene sets and canonical pathways from public pathway databases, including KEGG (Release 57.0), BioCarta, and Reactome (downloaded on Feb, 2011).\\n\\nWe also created a gene ID database to convert various input identifiers into standard gene symbols with HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) (downloaded on Feb, 2011) data for the standard gene symbols and with Entrez Gene (downloaded on Feb, 2011) and UniProt (Release 2011_03) data for the gene IDs, protein IDs, and functional annotations.\\n\\nTitle: Input types\\n\\nAvailable input types include a list of gene symbols, Entrez gene IDs, or UniProt accessions and output files from prediction tools, such as Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) [10] and PolyPhen [11], which evaluate functional effects of mutations on proteins.\\n\\nCaGe parses the output of those tools to extract the list of genes that have somatic mutations evaluated as functionally damaging, classify them into previously reported and novel candidate cancer genes, and conduct pathway analyses to give insights into underlying carcinogenic mechanisms.\\n\\nThus, CaGe offers straightforward data processing from HGT-based data without additional data conversion.\\n\\nTitle: Cancer gene and pathway annotation workflow\\n\\nAfter acquiring user input, CaGe converts various input gene IDs into standard gene symbols, finds known cancer genes and pathways, links various cancer-related annotations to matched genes, and outputs them in the form of tables or text files through the web interface (Fig.3).\\n\\nAnother function of CaGe is to identify over-represented cancer-related or other biological pathways from the input gene list by performing one-tailed Fisher's exact test.\\n\\nWhen processing more than one annotation job, users can manage their annotation tasks through the CaGe interface, and access to their results is maintained by the internal job database of CaGe until the jobs are deleted by the user or by a scheduled cleaning process.\\n\\nThe IP addresses of client computers are used for secured job management without a logon process.\\n\\nCompleted annotation jobs are listed on the job table, and the annotated results can be shown selectively by the user on the annotation result page or can be downloaded as tab-delimited text files for further analyses.\\n\\nThe annotation on the results page has many useful links to gene and cancer-related information in the CaGe database or external public databases.\\n\\nIn addition to the cancer gene and pathway annotation function, CaGe provides a function to browse cancer genes and pathways so that users can search cancer-related annotations without an input list.\\n\\nThe search flows of cancer genes and pathways are connected to each other by crosslinks in the cancer gene information page or pathway information page.\\n\\nTitle: Database and web interface\\n\\nBased on the reported cancer-related gene sets from CGC and CGI, a cancer gene database and a cancer pathway gene database were constructed by the described methods.\\n\\nIn total, 436 CGC-originated and 7181 CGI-originated cancer genes were prepared for the reported cancer gene annotation.\\n\\nAdditionally, 5,790 CGC-based and 6,744 CGI-based cancer pathway genes were assigned for the annotation of unreported but potential candidate genes (Table 1).\\n\\nThe gene ID database for gene symbol conversion, based on HGNC, and the functional annotation database, based on Entrez Gene and UniProt database flat files, were constructed.\\n\\nThe types of annotations provided by CaGe are summarized in Table 2.\\n\\nThe main window of the CaGe web interface is shown in Fig.2 for the cancer gene annotation process.\\n\\nMain menus, located in the upper part of the main window, are linked to the four main functions and home page of the system: 1) home page, 2) cancer gene annotation function, 3) cancer pathway annotation function, 4) cancer gene browsing function, and 5) cancer pathway browsing function.\\n\\nDetailed usages for CaGe are described in the user's guide at http://mgrc.kribb.re.kr/cage/include/cageUserGuide.pdf.\\n\\nTitle: System information\\n\\nCaGe was developed using PHP, R, and python languages; MySQL for database management; and Apache for the web server and is operated on a Linux platform with 8-core Intel Xeon CPUs (2.33 GHz) and 24 GB of main memory.\\n\\nTitle: Performance evaluation with small cell lung cancer mutation data\\n\\nTo assess the capability of CaGe, we annotated genes from candidate mutations for a small cell lung cancer genome (SCLC) [12].\\n\\nWe had 59 genes with predicted functionally damaging mutations after applying 22,910 mutations to the PolyPhen and could annotate 22 previously reported known cancer genes successfully by applying the PolyPhen output for CaGe.\\n\\nKnown cancer genes included RB1, which was mentioned as an SCLC-related gene in Pleasance's work; DST and ETS2, which were previously reported as SCLC-related genes but not mentioned in Pleasance's work; and 3 more genes (PDGFC, IL16, and AGTR2), which are known as lung cancer-related genes (Supplementary Table 1).\\n\\nThe other 16 genes are known to be related to other cancer types, suggesting that they might be important in the carcinogenesis of SCLC as well.\\n\\nFrom the pathway analysis, we identified 12 known cancer genes and 11 genes in cancer-related pathways (Supplementary Table 2).\\n\\nThose 11 genes might also be important in the carcinogenesis of SCLC.\\n\\nThus, we conclude that CaGe can annotate cancer genes effectively and suggest that CaGe will be useful in the identification of cancer-causing mutations and genes in HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nIn this paper, we present a new cancer genomic tool, CaGe, for the assessment of candidate cancer genes having somatic mutations from HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nCaGe provides users with information on cancer genes, mutations, pathways, and associated annotations through cancer gene annotation, cancer pathway annotation, cancer gene browsing, and cancer pathway browsing functions.\\n\\nIt has a capacity to process SIFT or PolyPhen output files as direct input for usual NGS-based cancer genomics flows.\\n\\nResearchers can classify their candidate genes from cancer genome studies into previously known or novel categories of cancer genes and gain insight into the underlying carcinogenic mechanisms through a pathway analysis.\\n\\nWe hope that CaGe will be useful for the identification of cancer-causing mutations and genes in HGT-based cancer genomics.\\n\\nConstruction and main service flows of CaGe.\\n\\nSIFT, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant; NGS, next-generation DNA sequencing; HGNC, HUGO Gene

       " \"Title: Decreases in Casz1 mRNA by an siRNA Complex Do not Alter Blood Pressure in Mice\\n\\nRecent genomewide association studies of large samples have identified genes that are associated with blood pressure.\\n\\nThe Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPgen) and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genome Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortiums identified 14 loci that govern blood pressure on a genomewide significance level, one of which is CASZ1 confirmed in both Europeans and Asians.\\n\\nCASZ1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that controls apoptosis and cell fate and suppresses neuroblastoma tumor growth by reprogramming gene expression, like a tumor suppressor.\\n\\nTo validate the function of CASZ1 in blood pressure, we decreased Casz1 mRNA levels in mice by siRNA.\\n\\nCasz1 siRNA reduced mRNA levels by 59% in a mouse cell line.\\n\\nA polyethylenimine-mixed siRNA complex was injected into mouse tail veins, reducing Casz1 mRNA expression to 45% in the kidney.\\n\\nHowever, blood pressure in the treated mice was unaffected, despite a 55% reduction in Casz1 mRNA levels in the kidney on multiple siRNA injections daily.\\n\\nEven though Casz1 siRNA-treated mice did not experience any significant change in blood pressure, our study demonstrates the value of in vivo siRNA injection in analyzing the function of candidate genes identified by genomewide association studies.\\n\\nCASZ1 gene is a zinc finger transcription factor that controls cell fate, although little is known about its function [1].\\n\\nCASZ1 is also known as a survival-related gene that has 2 isoforms.\\n\\nIt encodes a putative protein of 172 amino acids that localizes predominantly in the perinuclear region, as predicted for transcription factors.\\n\\nCASZ1 is highly expressed in many human cancer cell lines, although its expression is low in most tissues, implicating it in tumor growth [2].\\n\\nThese findings indicate that CASZ1 is important for cell proliferation, development, and differentiation, as well as carcinogenesis.\\n\\nHowever, CASZ1 has recently been reported to be significantly associated with blood pressure and hypertension in genomewide association studies (GWASs) [3].\\n\\nBlood pressure GWASs by the Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPgen) [4] and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genome Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium [5] have identified 14 independent loci that govern blood pressure or hypertension at a genomewide significance level, 7 of which were replicated in the Japanese population (CASZ1, MTHFR, ITGA9, FGF5, CYP17A1-CNNM2, ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3) [6].\\n\\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs880315, which lies in an intron of CASZ1, was one of the 7 replicate loci (p = 2.2 × 10-8, p = 4.9 × 10-12, and p = 3.0 × 10-7 for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and hypertension, respectively).\\n\\nCASZ1 was also linked to blood pressure in the Women's Genome Health Study (rs880315; p = 5.2 × 10-9 for systolic blood pressure) [7].\\n\\nRecently, the CASZ1 locus was identified in 19,608 subjects of east Asian ancestry by the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network Blood Pressure (AGEN-BP) consortium [8].\\n\\nAlthough these blood pressure GWASs have suggested that these loci control blood pressure, their function in blood pressure has not been examined.\\n\\nTraditionally, knockout or transgenic mice have been used to reveal gene function and can be good approaches for examining candidate genes that lie near the GWAS loci [9].\\n\\nHowever, this process is expensive and time-consuming [10], requiring technical advances to determine their function in vivo.\\n\\nSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) is an alternative approach that has the potential to become the preferred tool for that purpose [11].\\n\\nIn vivo injection of siRNA reduces gene expression by 70% to 80% in certain tissues in mice, demonstrating its efficacy [12].\\n\\nHowever, specific tissues can not be targeted by in vivo injection of siRNA, and the injected siRNA is unstable in blood serum, limiting their use in delivering siRNA in vivo.\\n\\nIt also has certain disadvantages, such as effecting inflammatory responses and toxicity [13].\\n\\nThus, developing siRNA delivery methods in animal models is a challenging but worthy effort to accelerate the discovery of novel genes [11].\\n\\nWe sought to determine whether murine Casz1 controls blood pressure by administering Casz1 siRNA to mice.\\n\\nA polyethylenimine-mixed siRNA complex was injected into tail veins, and changes in Casz1 mRNA and blood pressure were measured.\\n\\nTitle: Animals\\n\\nBALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were bred in a pathogen-free facility and used at 7 to 9 weeks of age for siRNA injection.\\n\\nThe mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature with free access to food and water.\\n\\nEvery effort was made to minimize the number of animals that was used and their suffering per the Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University (KHP-2010-04-06).\\n\\nTitle: Synthesis of siRNA\\n\\nCasz1 siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genolution (Seoul, Korea).\\n\\nThe target sequence for Casz1 was 5'-GATGTGATCCGACATTACA-3' (siRNA#1), 5'-CTAGAACTGCTCTGTATGT-3' (siRNA#2), and 5'-CAATTCGGCAAGTAATGGA-3' (siRNA #3), and nonspecific scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control.\\n\\nTo examine the efficacy of siRNAs, siRNAs were transfected into B16F10 cells using G-Fectin (Genolution); 1-2 µL of G-Fectin and 20 nM siRNA were added to 50 µL phosphate buffered saline, and the reaction was incubated for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\\n\\nB16F10 cells were used to seed 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and 30% confluence, and the transfection mixture was added to the plate.\\n\\nThe cells were harvested for RNA extraction after 24 h of incubation.\\n\\nTotal RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) per the manufacturer's instructions.\\n\\nTitle: Delivery methods\\n\\nThe transfection agent was in vivo-jetPEI™ (Polyplus, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France).\\n\\nPer the manufacturer, 25 µg siRNA and 6.5 µL vivo-jetPEI™ (N/P charge ratio of 6) were diluted with 50 µL 10% glucose solution and 50 µL sterile H2O.\\n\\nThe solution was vortexed gently and left for 15 min at RT.\\n\\nThe mixture was injected into the tail veins of 7- to 9-week-old mice, and the treated mice were measured for blood pressure or sacrificed for RNA extraction.\\n\\nTitle: RNA extraction and real-time PCR\\n\\nRNA was extracted from the tissues of siRNA-treated mice with TRIzol (Invitrogen).\\n\\nWe synthesized cDNA from 500 ng of total RNA using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) per the manufacturer's protocol.\\n\\nCasz1 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR.\\n\\nOne-tenth of the cDNA reaction was added to a final volume of 20 µL for each reaction containing SYBR Green I (TaKaRa).\\n\\nThe primers for Casz1 and glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were 5'-GTCTCTTCGGGAACTGCAAG-3'/5'-TGGGACACAGGCACTGTAGA-3' and 5'-GCTCTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTC-3'/5'-CAATACGACCAAATCCGTTG-3', respectively (forward/reverse sequence).\\n\\nQuantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Step One Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA) using the following program: 45 cycles of 95℃ for 10 s, 60℃ for 15 s, and 72℃ for 20 s. To normalize the amount of sample cDNA in each reaction, the Ct value of each target gene was subtracted by that of GAPDH to obtain delta Ct [14].\\n\\nTo calculate the fold-change in expression, the delta Ct value of the case sample was subtracted by that of the control (delta delta Ct = delta Ct case - delta Ct control).\\n\\nReverse-transcription PCR was performed similarly to quantitative real-time PCR, except that it used 35 cycles for amplification.\\n\\nThe PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 2.0% agarose gel and visualized under UV lamp after ethidium bromide staining.\\n\\nTitle: Blood pressure measurement\\n\\nBlood pressure was recorded intraarterially with a computerized data acquisition system (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia).\\n\\nTo place the intraarterial catheter, mice were anesthetized with avertin.\\n\\nThe standard dose was 0.014 mL/g avertin, which was made by diluting stock solution (for stock solution, 10 g 2,2,2, tribromoethanol dissolved in 10 mL tertiary amyl alcohol) 40-fold in 0.9% NaCl.\\n\\nThe intraarterial catheter, a polyethylene tube (0.2 mm I.D., 0.5 mm O.D.)\\n\\n(Natsume, Tokyo, Japan) that was filled with 0.9% NaCl containing 100 U/mL heparin, was inserted into the right carotid artery and tied in place.\\n\\nThe blood pressure in the vessel was transmitted along the catheter to the transducer's diaphragm (MLT0699 Disposable BP Transducer; ADInstruments).\\n\\nThe diaphragm signal was amplified through a Bridge Amplifier and recorded on a PowerLab system (LabChart 7.2; ADInstruments).\\n\\nBlood pressure was monitored for 2 h after the injection of the anesthetic and calculated as the average blood pressure between 45 min and 75 min after the injection (1 point per min).\\n\\nStatistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and differences in blood pressure between case and control groups were analyzed by independent sample t-test.\\n\\nTitle: Reduction in Casz1 mRNA by siRNA injection into tail vein\\n\\nWe examined the efficacies of 3 Casz1 siRNA oligonucleotides in the B16F10 mouse melanoma cell line.\\n\\nBy real-time PCR, Casz1 mRNA levels fell 0%, 59%, and 54%, and we selected the second siRNA for the in vivo experiments.\\n\\nPrior to the injection of siRNA, Casz1 expression in heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and brain was measured by reverse-transcription PCR.\\n\\nCasz1 was expressed in most tissues and at relatively low levels in liver (Fig.1).\\n\\nCasz1 siRNA was mixed with polyethylenimine, and the complex was injected into the tail veins of mice.\\n\\nAt 24 h after siRNA injection, various tissues of siRNA-treated mice were analyzed with regard to Casz1 mRNA levels.\\n\\nCasz1 mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH, and a scrambled siRNA was used as control.\\n\\nBy quantitative real-time PCR, Casz1 mRNA levels declined only in kidney (Fig.2A).\\n\\nCasz1 mRNA levels in the kidney fell by 45%, 55%, and 25% after 1, 2, and 3 injections per day, respectively (n = 3 for each group) (Fig.2B).\\n\\nTitle: Blood pressure in siRNA-injected mice\\n\\nBlood pressure was measured 24 h after tail vein injection of the scrambled or Casz1 siRNA (control, n = 4; case, n = 3).\\n\\nUsing an intraarterial catheter that was connected to a pressure sensor, we recorded blood pressure continuously for 2 h after anesthesia.\\n\\nBlood pressure did not change after a 1-time injection (p = 0.713).\\n\\nThus, we injected siRNA twice each day (control, n = 4; case, n = 6) but did not observe any significant difference between the case and control groups (p = 0.545).\\n\\nAfter 3 siRNA injections daily for 3 days, blood pressure was also unaffected (p = 0.297) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).\\n\\nThis study attempted to validate CASZ1 as a regulator of blood pressure using siRNA in mice.\\n\\nAlthough Casz1 mRNA levels decreased by 55% in kidney, blood pressure did not change on injection of the siRNA complex into tail veins.\\n\\nIt is difficult to conclude that CASZ1 does not control blood pressure, because this study has several limitations.\\n\\nFirst, Casz1 mRNA levels in kidney were reduced up to 55%; if Casz1 expression had been abolished, we might have detected a significant difference in blood pressure between the case and control groups.\\n\\nSecond, it is possible that CASZ1 functions in other tissues besides the kidney in the regulation of blood pressure.\\n\\nThe kidney is an essential organ of the urinary system and controls homeostatic functions, such as the regulation of blood pressure, by maintaining salt and water balances.\\n\\nHowever, the function of CASZ1 in kidney is unknown due to the lack of Casz1 functional studies in kidney.\\n\\nCasz1 is highly expressed in brain, but siRNA nanoparticles do not access the brain due to the blood-brain barrier [15].\\n\\nThird, human CASZ1 is 87% and 90% identical to mouse Casz1 in the cDNA and polypeptide sequences, respectively [1].\\n\\nNevertheless, it is possible that Casz1 function differs between the two species.\\n\\nBecause most loci that have been identified by GWASs have several genes nearby, it may be necessary to examine many candidates to identify the functional gene.\\n\\nKnockout and transgenic mice are expensive and time-consuming to generate.\\n\\nIn contrast, siRNA injection costs less and is much faster to perform, making siRNA injection suitable for functional validation studies of GWAS results.\\n\\nIn summary, we did not observe any significant change in blood pressure in Casz1 siRNA-treated mice, but our study demonstrates the value of in vivo siRNA injection in the functional analysis of candidate genes from GWASs.\\n\\nCasz1 mRNA expression in normal mouse tissues.\\n\\nGAPDH, glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\\n\\nDecreases in Casz1 mRNA by an siRNA complex.\\n\\n(A) Fold-change in Casz1 mRNA levels in tissues in siRNA-injected mice (n = 2 per tissue).\\n\\n(B) Reduction in Casz1 mRNA levels in kidney by in vivo siRNA injection.\\n\\nTitle: Blood pressure in siRNA-injected mice\\n\\n\"]"

      "Title: Survey of the Applications of NGS to Whole-Genome Sequencing and Expression Profiling\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the technologies of DNA sequence variation and gene expression profiling have been used widely as approaches in the expertise of genome biology and genetics.\n",
      "The application to genome study has been particularly developed with the introduction of the next-generation DNA sequencer (NGS) Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa systems, along with bioinformation analysis technologies of whole-genome de novo assembly, expression profiling, DNA variation discovery, and genotyping.\n",
      "Both massive whole-genome shotgun paired-end sequencing and mate paired-end sequencing data are important steps for constructing de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing data.\n",
      "It is necessary to have DNA sequence information from a multiplatform NGS with at least 2× and 30× depth sequence of genome coverage using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, for effective an way of de novo assembly.\n",
      "Massive short-length reading data from the Illumina/Solexa system is enough to discover DNA variation, resulting in reducing the cost of DNA sequencing.\n",
      "Whole-genome expression profile data are useful to approach genome system biology with quantification of expressed RNAs from a whole-genome transcriptome, depending on the tissue samples.\n",
      "The hybrid mRNA sequences from Rohce/454 and Illumina/Solexa are more powerful to find novel genes through de novo assembly in any whole-genome sequenced species.\n",
      "The 20× and 50× coverage of the estimated transcriptome sequences using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, is effective to create novel expressed reference sequences.\n",
      "However, only an average 30× coverage of a transcriptome with short read sequences of Illumina/Solexa is enough to check expression quantification, compared to the reference expressed sequence tag sequence.\n",
      "Scientists have tried to understand biology through DNA sequence information, since the DNA is verified as the unit of genetic heredity.\n",
      "Also, scientists hope to dramatically reduce the cost of reading genomic DNA and to obtain the high-throughput DNA sequence information.\n",
      "Since the automated DNA sequencers were developed with fluorescent dyes of different colors, laser, and computer technology in the 1980s, the human genome project (HGP) was begun in 1990, and the human genome was completely released in 2003, while further analysis is still being published.\n",
      "A total of about 3 billion dollars was invested to the project.\n",
      "In 1991, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funds were geared toward lowering the cost of DNA sequencing.\n",
      "Some of technologies invested improved the DNA sequencing.\n",
      "To date, the Applied Biosystems, Roche/454, and Illumina/Solexa have successfully developed their technology and applied DNA sequencing in the world during the recent 6 years.\n",
      "Most of the newest technologies currently in use generate sequences from 36 to 1,000 base pairs, which requires special software for different applications, including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and regulatory gene analysis.\n",
      "In particular, in silico method development using bioinformation software for next-generation sequence assembly would be alert for many genome projects and more applications in genome biology.\n",
      "Particularly, many biologists and geneticists using massive DNA and RNA sequences have used the sequencing applications focused on the variable research fields in medicine, such as improved diagnosis of disease; gene therapy; control systems for drugs, including pharmacogenomics \"custom drugs;\" evolution; bioenergy and environmental applications of creative energy sources (biofuels); clean up of toxic wastes, including efficient environmental sources against carbon; and agriculture projects, including livestock of healthier, more productive, disease-resistant farm animals and breeding of disease-, insect-, and drought-resistant crops.\n",
      "In this paper, we report several ways of genome sequencing and expression profiling in genome biology.\n",
      "Title: Roche/454 pyrosequencing technology\n",
      "\n",
      "The first high-parallel sequencing system was developed with an emulsion PCR method for DNA amplification and an instrument for sequencing by synthesis using a pyrosequencing protocol optimized on the individual well of a PicoTiterPlate (PTP) [1].\n",
      "The DNA sequencing protocol, including sample preparation, is supplied for a user to follow the method, which is developed by 454 Life Science (now part of Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).\n",
      "Even following the manufacturer's protocol, to obtain high-quality DNA sequence with maximal total DNA sequence length as possible, one should make a library with both adapters on the sheared DNA fragment and mix the optical ratio of library DNA versus bead for emulsion PCR.\n",
      "Now, the system is upgraded to through-put a total of an average of 700 Mbp with an average 600 bp/read in one PTP run.\n",
      "The sequencer is available for single reads and paired-end read sequencing for the application of eukaryotic and prokaryotic whole-genome sequencing [2, 3], metagenomics and microbial diversity [4, 5], and genetic variation detection for comparative genomics [6].\n",
      "Title: Illumina/Solexa technology\n",
      "\n",
      "The numerous cost-effective technologies were being developed for human genome resequencing that can be aligned to the reference sequence [7, 8].\n",
      "The first successful technology to gain massive DNA sequencing available for resequencing was developed by Solexa (now part of Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).\n",
      "The principle of the system is the method of base-by-base sequencing by synthesis, where the sheared template DNA is amplified on the flat surface slide (flow cell) and detects one base on each template per cycle with four base-specific, fluorescently labeled signals.\n",
      "Signals for all four fluorescent channels are collected and plotted at each position, enabling quality per scores to be derived using four-color information if desired [8].\n",
      "Now, a maximum of 300 Gb for reading is available with 101 bp paired-end reading per fragment on a 1-flow cell run in the upgraded HiSeq system.\n",
      "Title: Novel whole genome de novo assembly\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 11,000 sequencing projects, including targeted projects, were reported on the Genome Online Database (GOLD, http://www.genomesonline.org) in early 2012.\n",
      "Now, more than 3,000 genome projects have been completed on the diverse genome species, and more than 90% of completed projects were bacterial genome sequencing.\n",
      "The greatest bacterial genome sequencing was performed with 454 pyrosequencing because of the available largest long read sequencing, useful for de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing.\n",
      "The official depth of the deep sequencing strategy of 454 pyrosequencing technology for whole bacterial genome sequencing for de novo assembly in novel genome sequencing is at least 15-20× in depth of the estimated genome size [9-13].\n",
      "However, Li et al.\n",
      "[3] reported that 6-10× sequencing in qualified runs with 500-bp reads would be enough for de novo assemblies from 1,480 prokaryote genomes with >98% genome coverage, <100 contigs with N50, and size >100 kb.\n",
      "Recently, prokaryote whole genome sequencing using 101 bp paired-end read data from Illumina/Solexa systems was used for de novo assembly and resequencing.\n",
      "For example, a Bacillus subtilis subspecies genome sequence was generated by using the short read sequence from Illumina/Solexa and assembled with the Velvet program [14].\n",
      "In this case, the genome assembly was completed, based on the reference genome for ordering the numerous contigs derived from de novo assembly.\n",
      "Even though numerous contigs assembled with Illumina/Solexa data were produced in the eukaryotic genome, a few drafts for the assembled genome sequence were reported, except for the giant panda genome [15], which was covered with assembled contigs (2.25 Gb), covering approximately 94% of the expected whole genome.\n",
      "Another example was the woodland strawberry genome (240 Mb) [16] that was sequenced to 39× depth of the genome, assembled de novo, and anchored to the linkage map of seven pseudochromosomes.\n",
      "The genome sequence could be associated with the predicted genes with transcriptome sequence data.\n",
      "An ideal method for cost-effective novel genome sequencing using NGS is de novo assembly with diverse shotgun fragment end sequencing data of multiplat systems (Fig.1).\n",
      "The first strategy of novel genome DNA sequencing is sequencing the genomic DNA for contig and scaffold construction after randomly sheared shotgun single read-end or paired-end read DNA sequencing using Roche/454 or Illumina/Solexa with information on how to assemble with the NGS data using variable assembly software.\n",
      "Recently, a catfish genome was sequenced with multiplatform Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa technology and assembled with an effective combination of low coverage depth of 18× Roche/454 and 70× Illumina/Solexa data using 3 assembly softwares - Newbler software to the 454 reads, Velvet assembler to the Illumina read, and MIRA assembler for final assembly of contigs and singletons derived from initial assembled data - resulting in 193 contigs with an N50 value of 13,123 bp [2].\n",
      "In an additional multiplatform data assembly of a 40-Mb eukaryotic genome of the fungus Sordaria macrospra, a combination sequence of 85-fold coverage of Illumina/Solexa and 10-fold coverage by Roche/454 sequencing was assembled to a 40-Mb draft version (N50 of 117 kb) with the Velvet assembler as a reference of a model organism for fungal morphogenesis [17].\n",
      "In the recent effective assembly methods reported, combinations of the multiplatform sequence are shown as successful novel genome assembly using variable assembly strategy pipelines.\n",
      "Comparing the pipeline of assembly strategy, we suggest an effective integrated pipeline in which data are filtered to remove low-quality and short-read initial assemblies using variable software and then compared to contigs, hybrid contigs using MIRA assembler, and finally contig orders using SSPACE software (http://www.baseclear.com/dna-sequencing/data-analysis/) [18] for scaffold construction through de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing (Fig.2).\n",
      "According to the comparison of several ways of de novo assembly, we suggest using both DNA sequences from multiplatform NGS with at least 2× and 30× depth sequences of genome coverage using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, and doing hybrid assembly for cost-effective novel genome sequencing.\n",
      "Title: SNP discovery and genotyping with resequencing\n",
      "\n",
      "Resequencing of genomic regions or target genes of interest in a phenotype is the first step in the detection of DNA variations associated with the gene regulation.\n",
      "The discovery of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including insertion/deletions (indels), with high-throughput data is useful to study genetic variation, comparative genomics, linkage map, and genomic selection for breeding value with DNA variation.\n",
      "Many geneticists for biological and genome studies of microbial, plant, animal, and human genomes have effectively used NGS whole-genome resequencing data to use in variable research fields, such as bacterial evolution [19], genomewide analysis of mutagenesis of Escherichia coli strains [20], comparative genomics of Streptococcus suis of swine pathogen [21], genomic variation effects on phenotype and gene regulation in mouse [22], evolution of plant [23], and comparison of genetic variations on the targeted enrichment [24].\n",
      "The platforms of resequencing projects have used Illumina/Solexa of short read lengths to align with the reference sequence to discover DNA variations between compared related species' sequences.\n",
      "Because of rare occurrence of SNPs in most species, it is important to identify high-accuracy data to discover DNA variations according to coverage depth using MAQ (http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml) [25] and CLC software (http://www.clcbio.com).\n",
      "The public protocol of covering depth to discover SNPs and indels on the heterogeneous genome requires at least 30× of the reference genome, while about 10× depth of coverage is enough for DNA variation study of homogeneous genomes.\n",
      "Of course, high coverage of depth provides high-quality data in SNP detection on the reference mapping (Fig.3).\n",
      "However, short read lengths of 35 bp or 100 bp show enough to map on the reference sequence using the MAQ software and CLC software in the genome, including short repeated block regions.\n",
      "But, geneticists still require long-read sequencing data to distinguish repeated block regions, like paralogous regions derived from gene duplication.\n",
      "MAQ software provides a consensus sequence of the genotype sequenced of short read lengths with aligned raw reads to the reference sequence.\n",
      "CLC software checks accuracy by counting reads of DNA variations of each position.\n",
      "Recently, a novel application of pattern recognition for accurate DNA variations was discovered in the complexity of the genomic region using high-throughput data in a Caucasian population [26].\n",
      "They used three independent datasets with Sanger sequencing and Affymetrix and Illumina microarrays to validate SNPs and indels of a clinical target region, FKBP5.\n",
      "Therefore, it is necessary for multiplatform systems to validate DNA variations in the specific complexity of the genome region.\n",
      "Title: Expression profiling\n",
      "\n",
      "Gene expression profiling is a measurement of the regulation of a transcriptome from the whole genome in the field of molecular biology.\n",
      "A conventional method to measure the relative activity of target genes is DNA microarray technology, which estimates expressed genes with the signals of hybridization of target genes (cDNA from mRNA) on the synthesized oligonucleotides [27].\n",
      "The technology is still used for functional genomics in the wide era, including medicine, clinic, plant, and agricultural biotechnology [28-30].\n",
      "In addition, microarray technology is also used in the comparative study of proteomics and expression, measuring the level of extracellular matrix protein [30].\n",
      "Since NGS technology was developed in 2005, the transcriptome of novel whole genomes could be identified with massive parallel mRNA sequencing using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa [31-36].\n",
      "The Roche/454 system is more useful for gaining novel gene discovery of novel species' genomes for long read sequencing [37, 38].\n",
      "Otherwise, Illumina/Solexa is being used to profile the expression of known genes with mapping short read sequences to the known reference genes [39, 40].\n",
      "In that case, rare expressed genes and novel genes could be identified with high-throughput expressed sequence tag sequences using Illumina/Solexa.\n",
      "Also, it is useful to find significant tissue-specific expression biases with comparison of transcript data [22].\n",
      "Now, the hybrid mRNA sequence from Rohce/454 and Illumina/Solexa is more powerful for finding novel genes through de novo assembly in any whole-genome species.\n",
      "The hybrid sequence data of 20× and 50× coverage of the estimated transcriptome sequence from Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, is effective in creating novel expressed reference sequences, while short-read Illumina/Solexa data are cost-efficient on expression quantification information for comparing exposed samples and natural phenotype samples through mapping to the reference genes (Fig.4).\n",
      "Only and average 30× coverage of transcriptome depth of short-read sequences of Illumina/Solexa is enough to check expression quantification, compared to reference expressed sequence tag sequences.\n",
      "The expressed information could be different, depending on the software using CAP3, MIRA, Newbler, SeqMan, and CLC.\n",

      "\n",
      "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by formation of multiple fluid-filled cysts that expand over time and destroy renal architecture.\n",
      "The proteins encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, mutations in which account for nearly all cases of ADPKD, may help guard against cystogenesis.\n",
      "Previously developed mouse models of PKD1 and PKD2 demonstrated an embryonic lethal phenotype and massive cyst formation in the kidney, indicating that PKD1 and PKD2 probably play important roles during normal renal tubular development.\n",
      "However, their precise role in development and the cellular mechanisms of cyst formation induced by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations are not fully understood.\n",
      "To address this question, we presently created Pkd2 knockout and PKD2 transgenic mouse embryo fibroblasts.\n",
      "We used a mouse oligonucleotide microarray to identify messenger RNAs whose expression was altered by the overexpression of the PKD2 or knockout of the Pkd2.\n",
      "The majority of identified mutations was involved in critical biological processes, such as metabolism, transcription, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and signal transduction.\n",
      "Herein, we confirmed differential expressions of several genes including aquaporin-1, according to different PKD2 expression levels in ADPKD mouse models, through microarray analysis.\n",
      "These data may be helpful in PKD2-related mechanisms of ADPKD pathogenesis.\n",
      "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenetic disorder, affecting as many as 1 in 500 people in the general population.\n",
      "The disease is characterized by the formation of multiple fluid-filled renal cysts that expand over time and destroy the architecture of the kidney.\n",
      "Five percent of all cases of chronic renal failure are due to ADPKD, and approximately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal disease by the time they are 60 years of age [1].\n",
      "In the early stages of ADPKD, numerous cysts begin to enlarge from many segments of the kidney.\n",
      "Later, the enlarged regions disassociate from the original nephron to form the actual cysts, which continue to enlarge due to proliferation of epithelial cells and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen.\n",
      "Progressive renal cyst formation and enlargement result in a loss of renal function and hypertension and culminate in renal failure.\n",
      "It is generally believed that cysts enlarge by means of abnormal cell growth, forming what is essentially a fluid-filled tumor that fills by transepithelial fluid secretion.\n",
      "Cyst enlargement may then lead to extracellular matrix remodeling, interstitial fibrosis, a general inflammatory response, and disruption of the normal renal parenchyma, which then interfere with glomerular filtration and vascular blood flow, giving rise to cell death by apoptosis and ultimately renal failure [2].\n",
      "Many studies have indicated that most cases of ADPKD are accounted for by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding the transmembrane protein polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively.\n",
      "Mice with targeted mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes develop cystic kidneys during embryogenesis, and ADPKD in humans is associated with mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes [3, 4].\n",
      "In addition, the product of the PKD1 gene, PC1, has been implicated in a variety of pathways tied to proliferation, including G-protein signaling and the Wnt, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription cascades [5, 6].\n",
      "Moreover, depletion of PC1 has been shown to increase cell growth, whereas its overexpression slows cell growth, indicating that PC1 may negatively regulate cell proliferation [7, 8].\n",
      "PC2, the protein product of PKD2, has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation via its calcium channel activity and stimulation of AP-1 [9, 10]; however, there has been little direct evidence tying PC2 to this process.\n",
      "Here, we created a number of related cell lines that varied in their expression of PC2.\n",
      "We describe studies designed to identify target genes under the control of the PKD2 using Pkd2 knockout (KO) and PKD2 transgenic (TG) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs).\n",

      "\n",
      "Pattern discovery in biological sequences (e.g., DNA sequences) is one of the most challenging tasks in computational biology and bioinformatics.\n",
      "So far, in most approaches, the number of occurrences is a major measure of determining whether a pattern is interesting or not.\n",
      "In computational biology, however, a pattern that is not frequent may still be considered very informative if its actual support frequency exceeds the prior expectation by a large margin.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose a new interesting measure that can provide meaningful biological information.\n",
      "We also propose an efficient index-based method for mining such interesting patterns.\n",
      "Experimental results show that our approach can find interesting patterns within an acceptable computation time.\n",
      "Biological sequences, such as DNA sequences, have a great number of contiguous patterns consisting of frequent items.\n",
      "Which patterns are interesting to biologists?\n",
      "Is a pattern that occurs more frequently more interesting?\n",
      "So far, in most approaches, the number of occurrences has been a major measure of determining an interesting pattern.\n",
      "This measure, however, is not enough to discriminate a pattern from the background noise and may induce much time to spend for checking patterns of no biological meaning.\n",
      "Researchers are more interested in contiguous patterns that are statistically significant than those simply occurring frequently.\n",
      "The aim of mining interesting patterns is to analyze the important biological functions hidden in the extremely large amounts of genomic sequences.\n",
      "In this work, we aimed to discover surprising contiguous patterns that occur at a frequency higher than their expected frequencies.\n",
      "To find such surprising patterns with confidence, we chose to use a more suitable measure, information [1], which is widely studied and used in the field of communication.\n",
      "In information theory, if a pattern is expected to occur frequently based on some prior knowledge or by chance, then an occurrence of that pattern carries less information.\n",
      "Thus, we can use information to test the surprise of an occurrence of a pattern.\n",
      "The information gain is introduced to denote the accumulated information of a pattern in a DNA sequence and is used to exhibit the degree of surprise of the pattern.\n",
      "Many works for sequential pattern mining take an a priori approach, such as Agrawal and Srikant [2], who used downward closure property to prune infrequent patterns, which says that if a pattern is infrequent, all of its superpatterns must be infrequent.\n",
      "It suffers from the level-wise difficulty for candidate generation-and-test and needs several database scans for sequential pattern mining.\n",
      "A typical Apriori-like approach such as Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) [3] is a good example of this category.\n",
      "An efficient algorithm, PrefixSpan [4], has been proposed, representing projection-based sequential pattern mining.\n",
      "This approach examines only the prefix subsequences and projects only their corresponding postfix subsequences into the databases.\n",
      "Sequential patterns are grown by exploring length-1 frequent patterns in each projected database.\n",
      "Using the projected database, however, every expansion of sequential patterns needs a recursive process, which is not effective for DNA sequence mining.\n",
      "The problem of finding the frequent maximal contiguous pattern from sequences more than two has been introduced in [5-8].\n",

      "[10] have proposed a pattern discovery algorithm that can identify over-represented patterns inside DNA sequences by introducing a new measurement system.\n",
      "Another efficient algorithm, MacosVSpan [11], has been proposed, which gets the maximal subsequence of each data item by fixed-length spanning and finally looks for frequent maximal contiguous patterns using a suffix tree.\n",
      "Although this approach reduces recursive execution for expanding sequence patterns, it also suffers from the problem of producing and using projected databases.\n",
      "For long data sequences, the projected database grows much faster in comparison with the original database.\n",
      "Kang et al.\n",
      "[12] have proposed an approach to improve MacosVSpan using a fixed-length spanning tree, where each node maintains the frequency of subsequence overlapping.\n",
      "In this approach, all the candidates are produced first, including frequent and nonfrequent patterns; then, each candidate is scanned through the database to see whether it is frequent or not.\n",
      "This is obviously very time and memory-consuming.\n",
      "Recently, Zerin et al.\n",
      "[13] proposed a position-based fast method to find contiguous frequent patterns, which needs to scan the database only once to construct the fixed length spanning tree.\n",
      "This approach builds the fixed length spanning tree in the same fashion as Kang et al.\n",
      "[12] but records the sequence identification (ID) and starting position of the fixed length pattern with the frequency in the leaf node of the tree, showing better results than the previous methods.\n",

      "[12] - that is, read the database sequences and, starting from the first of each sequence, move the position one by one of the fixed length window throughout the sequence (Fig.1).\n",
      "We put the sequence ID and the starting position in the leaf node of the tree as a variable length array, in addition to the frequency of the pattern moving of the window.\n",
      "Fig.2 shows our proposed algorithm.\n",
      "It has two steps.\n",
      "The first step recursively scans the subsequence with the same length as the fixed-length window from the given sequences to construct a fixed-length spanning tree and put the database sequence ID and starting position of the pattern in the leaf node of tree as a one-side open variable length array.\n",
      "At this time, it calculates the character probabilities for A, C, G, and T, respectively.\n",
      "It is straightforward for the calculation of character probabilities for A, C, G, and T. By adding all occurrences of A, C, G, and T and dividing by the total number of characters in the database, it can be obtained easily.\n",
      "After calculating character probabilities, we can calculate character information, pattern information, and pattern information gain by using definition 5, definition 6, and definition 7.\n",
      "The second step generates fixed-length patterns from the constructed spanning tree with satisfying the minimum information gain threshold and minimum confidence threshold, and expands sequences by joining candidates and checking the frequency and starting position of the candidates.\n",
      "At the time of joining the sequences with the same length to generate the candidates of the next length, it checks whether the second candidate starts right to the next position of the first one with the same ID or not.\n",
      "If so, it increases the frequency counter by one.\n",
      "Finally, it checks the minimum information gain and minimum confidence threshold.\n",
      "If the pattern satisfies both thresholds, then it is added to the next-length candidate pattern.\n",
      "This process is recursively followed for all the candidates with the same length to generate the next-length surprising candidates.\n",
      "The spanning tree is shown in Fig.3, which is constructed based on the database available in Table 1.\n",
      "We have constructed a fixed-length spanning tree using the method suggested by Zerin et al.\n",
      "[13] but put the sequence ID and the staring position in the leaf node of the tree as a variable length array.\n",
      "Once the tree is constructed like Fig.3, retrieval of the tree can obtain contiguous subsequences with length-4, satisfying the satisfying minimum information gain threshold and minimum confidence threshold.\n",
      "Then, the obtained length-4 surprising contiguous patterns are 〈ATCG〉, 〈TCGT〉, 〈TGAT〉, 〈CGTG〉, 〈CGTT〉, 〈CATC〉, and 〈GTGA〉, shown in Fig.4.\n",
      "To generate the length-5 surprising contiguous patterns, we need to join the length-4 surprising patterns; all the items in the first pattern, excluding the first item, should be same as all the items of the second pattern, excluding the last item.\n",
      "The frequency counter of the next length pattern will increase if both of the patterns are present in the same sequence and the second pattern's starting positions are the right next to the position of the first pattern in the same sequence.\n",
      "If the generated patterns satisfy the min_in_gain and min_conf, we consider the new pattern as a next length surprising candidate.\n",
      "The obtained length-5 surprising patterns are 〈ATCGT〉, 〈TCGTG〉, 〈TCGTT〉, 〈CGTGA〉, 〈CATCG〉, and 〈GTGAT〉.\n",
      "From Fig.2, we see pattern ATCG starts from the 1st and 11th positions of sequence 10, 2nd and 9th positions of sequence 20, and 2nd position of sequence 30.\n",
      "The pattern TCGT starts from 3rd and 10th positions of sequence 20, 3rd position of sequence 30, and 1st position of sequence 40.\n",
      "As a result, the length-5 candidate ATCGT starts from the 2nd and 9th positions of sequence 20 and the 2nd position of sequence 30.\n",
      "So, the information gain of ATCGT is 14.065, and the confidence of ATCGT with respect to ATCG is 0.6, which satisfy both min_in_gain and min_conf thresholds.\n",

      "Mining interesting patterns from DNA sequences is one of the most challenging tasks in bioinformatics and computational biology.\n",
      "Maximal contiguous frequent patterns are preferable for expressing the function and structure of DNA sequences and hence can capture the common data characteristics among related sequences.\n",
      "Biologists are interested in finding frequent orderly arrangements of motifs that are responsible for similar expression of a group of genes.\n",
      "In order to reduce mining time and complexity, however, most existing sequence mining algorithms either focus on finding short DNA sequences or require explicit specification of sequence lengths in advance.\n",
      "The challenge is to find longer sequences without specifying sequence lengths in advance.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to mining maximal contiguous frequent patterns from large DNA sequence datasets.\n",
      "The experimental results show that our proposed approach is memory-efficient and mines maximal contiguous frequent patterns within a reasonable time.\n",
      "Mining patterns from DNA sequences refers to the task of discovering sequences that are similar or identical between different genomic locations or different genomes.\n",
      "How to efficiently discover long frequent contiguous sequences poses a great challenge for existing sequential pattern mining algorithms.\n",
      "The problem of finding the maximal contiguous frequent pattern is important in bioinformatics and has been used for predicting biological functions held in genomic sequences [1-4].\n",
      "In the beginning, the problem of finding common subsequences from sequences of more than 2 was studied [1, 2]; then, many tried to solve more general sequential pattern mining problems.\n",
      "A typical a priori algorithm, such as Generalized Sequential Pattern algorithm (GSP) [5, 6], adopts a multiple- pass, generation-and-test approach.\n",
      "In one pass, all single items (1-sequences) are counted.\n",
      "From the frequent items, a set of candidate 2-sequences are formed, and another pass is made to identify their frequency.\n",
      "The frequent 2-sequences are used to generate the candidate 3-sequences, and this process is repeated until no more frequent sequences are found.\n",
      "Normally, a hash tree-based search is employed for efficient support counting.\n",
      "Finally, non-maximal frequent sequences are removed.\n",
      "Based on this idea, a more efficient algorithm, called PrefixSpan [7], has been proposed, which examines only the prefix subsequences and projects only their corresponding postfix subsequences into the projected database (PDB).\n",
      "In each PDB, contiguous sequences are grown by exploring local length-1 frequent sequences.\n",
      "A memory-based pseudo-projection technique is developed to reduce the cost of projection and speed up processing.\n",
      "When mining long frequent concatenated sequences, however, this method becomes inefficient in terms of time and space.\n",
      "Therefore, it is impractical to apply PrefixSpan to mine long contiguous sequences, like biological datasets.\n",
      "Pan et al.\n",
      "[8] proposed to use a variable length spanning tree to mine maximal concatenated frequent subsequences and developed algorithms, called MacosFSpan and MacosVSpan, based on the PrefixSpan approach.\n",
      "MacosVSpan is efficient for mining long concatenated frequent sub-sequences, whereas MacosFSpan has some limitations, because it constructs length-4 fixed length candidate sequences first and recursively mines length-5, length-6 candidate sequences, etc.\n",
      "This is very time consuming, because in a practical DNA sequence database, a sub-sequence may occur multiple times in the same sequence.\n",
      "Another problem is that both MacosVSpan and MacosFSpan use the pointer-offset pair to represent the suffixes inside the in-memory pseudo PDB, which is not enough to represent the huge number of suffixes in a physical PDB.\n",
      "Kang et al.\n",
      "[9] have claimed that their algorithm is more efficient than the MacosVSpan algorithm, but it was based on MacosFSpan, which needed multiple scans of the database.\n",
      "Recently, Zerin et al.\n",
      "[10] have proposed an indexed-based method to find the frequent contiguous sequences with single database scanning.\n",
      "This approach builds the fixed-length spanning tree in a way similar to Kang et al.\n",
      "[9], but it records the sequence IDs and starting position of the fixed length patterns with frequency in the leaf node of the tree.\n",
      "Although this approach shows better results than its predecessors in terms of space, time complexity is still not acceptable.\n",
      "A practical DNA sequence database contains a large number of sequences, where a sub-sequence may occur multiple times in the same sequence.\n",
      "Therefore, we envisage using the concept of the suffix tree in terms of the variable length spanning tree of Pan et al.\n",
      "[8] to have the full advantages of prefix matching.\n",
      "Another aspect to consider is the size of real DNA sequence databases, which is ever increasing.\n",
      "For the cases where a DNA sequence database can not fit into the main memory, disk-based mining has been studied, based on partitioning [11-14].\n",
      "Most of these techniques, however, only consider local frequency counting, although many frequent patterns may look infrequent due to local support pruning.\n",

      "In order to efficiently discover frequent sub-sequences, we design a suffix tree structure that stores all the potential sub-sequences and their corresponding supports.\n",
      "A 'potential frequent sub-sequence' is a sub-sequence that has at least two matches with other suffixes inside the PDBs.\n",
      "Each PDB has its own corresponding sub-tree, defined as follows.\n",

      "This means that if we traverse a particular path from top to bottom, then the path from the root to this node represents a sub-sequence, and support of the last node in the path becomes the support of the sub-sequence.\n",
      "The height of the suffix tree is not fixed, because the lengths of the suffixes are variable.\n",

      "In this way, the size of physical PDB does not exceed the size of the original database.\n",

      "First, if the inserting sequence is contained by some suffixes in the PDBs, it will match a branch of the suffix tree; then, we delete it from the result set and increase support up to the matching point to stop inserting.\n",
      "Second, if the inserted sequence contains some sequence in the tree, denoted as α, one of its suffixes will match the branch representing α; then, we increase the support of α and delete it from the result set and continue to insert other suffixes.\n",

      "Intron prediction is an important problem of the constantly updated genome annotation.\n",
      "Using two model plant (rice and Arabidopsis) genomes, we compared two well-known intron prediction tools: the Blast-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) and Sim4cc.\n",
      "The results showed that each of the tools had its own advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      "BLAT predicted more than 99% introns of whole genomic introns with a small number of false-positive introns.\n",
      "Sim4cc was successful at finding the correct introns with a false-negative rate of 1.02% to 4.85%, and it needed a longer run time than BLAT.\n",
      "Further, we evaluated the intron information of 10 complete plant genomes.\n",
      "As non-coding sequences, intron lengths are not limited by a triplet codon frame; so, intron lengths have three phases: a multiple of three bases (3n), a multiple of three bases plus one (3n + 1), and a multiple of three bases plus two (3n + 2).\n",
      "It was widely accepted that the percentages of the 3n, 3n + 1, and 3n + 2 introns were quite similar in genomes.\n",
      "Our studies showed that 80% (8/10) of species were similar in terms of the number of three phases.\n",
      "The percentages of 3n introns in Ostreococcus lucimarinus was excessive (47.7%), while in Ostreococcus tauri, it was deficient (29.1%).\n",
      "This discrepancy could have been the result of errors in intron prediction.\n",
      "It is suggested that a three-phase evaluation is a fast and effective method of detecting intron annotation problems.\n",
      "With more and more species' genomes completely sequenced, noncoding sequences have become a focus of researchers' attention, especially for the study of introns.\n",
      "In order to facilitate further research, a number of intron databases have been developed (Table 1).\n",
      "The number of plant intron databases is much smaller than that in mammals and only in several model plants (such as Arabidopsis and rice).\n",
      "Using known genome sequences and coding sequences (expressed sequence tags [ESTs] or cDNA), introns can be detected by aligning coding sequences with genome sequences.\n",
      "Many tools were developed to detect introns in eukaryotes (Table 2) [1-16].\n",
      "These tools used different algorithms and computer languages (such as Java, C++, and Python) to predict introns.\n",
      "Therefore, the question is: there are many intron databases, algorithms, and detection methods for the study of eukaryotes, but which among them are the most suitable for the detection of plant introns?\n",
      "Among these tools, the Blast-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) and Sim4cc are the most commonly used tools.\n",
      "BLAT applies in genomewide alignment [11].\n",
      "Sim4cc is a tool for aligning cDNA and genomic sequences between species at various evolutionary distances [2].\n",
      "Rice and Arabidopsis, as monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous model plants, are widespread with regard to in-depth research.\n",
      "Their genome sequences have been annotated in detail, including their gene sequences, complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences, coding DNA sequence (CDS) sequences, exon sequences, intron sequences, and intergene sequences.\n",
      "Therefore, it is possible to use this model plant information to test these intron prediction tools.\n",
      "Genome annotation is a difficult and accurate project-even the best-annotated or most carefully studied genomes are continually re-released; e.g., release 7 of the Rice Genome Annotation Project was available on October 31, 2011 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/).\n",
      "But, determining the accuracy and detecting the inherent errors of the genome annotation is a problem.\n",
      "Since introns are removed from protein-coding transcripts, intron lengths are not expected to respect coding frames across the genome [17].\n",
      "Using intron length distributions, Roy and Penny [18] point out a rapid and simple method for detecting a variety of possible systematic biases in gene prediction or even problems with genome assemblies.\n",
      "Roy's method showed that a good genome annotation is accepted as roughly equal proportions of intron lengths of three phases: a multiple of three bases (3n), one more than a multiple of three bases (3n + 1), and two more (3n + 2).\n",
      "Skewed predicted intron length distributions thus suggest systematic errors in intron prediction.\n",
      "But, many plants with sequenced genomes have not been commented on.\n",
      "In this study, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of BLAT and Sim4cc for model plants' intron predictions, and we attempted to find a better way to predict the intron information of plants.\n",

      "2) We sliced gene sequences and cDNA sequences to folders by Perl script.\n",
      "In these folders, there was one sequence per file, and the gene name was the file name.\n",

      "Then, we got intron information from the Sim4cc results by Perl script.\n",
      "3) We compared the results of the two types of software (BLAT and Sim4cc) and then got the annotated intron information.\n",
      "4) We aligned intron sequences with their own gene sequences to develop detailed intron information, such as the intron position in the gene, intron length, intron number, forward-exon length, and backward-exon length, etc.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a prerequisite, it was assumed that the intron annotated information was correct and complete.\n",
      "Then, the software's results were compared with the annotated information.\n",
      "Three sets of results of intron information were obtained: two sets from the software (BLAT and Sim4cc) and one set from the annotated information (Table 4).\n",
      "Using BLAT, we found 99.35% and 99.87% of the introns of all rice and Arabidopsis annotated introns, respectively.\n",
      "These introns were almost all of the introns in the genome - that is, only 0.13% to 0.65% of the introns were not found.\n",
      "In contrast, by using Sim4cc, 95.15% to 98.98% of the introns were found (1.02% to 4.85% of the introns were lost) of all rice and Arabidopsis annotated introns.\n",
      "In summary, BLAT got more of the introns in a genome than Sim4cc.\n",
      "In light of this result, it seems as though that BLAT produces better results than Sim4cc.\n",
      "We found 30,194 rice genes with at least one intron by BLAT, but the number was 30,177 according to the annotated information.\n",
      "Because the BLAT results were larger than the annotated results, the BLAT results must have predicted some new and different genes with introns.\n",
      "In the BLAT results, many short-length introns (less than 50 bp) were predicted, but in fact, these short-length introns were part of transcript sequences and were not real intron sequences.\n",
      "In contrast, Sim4cc detected 29,875 genes with introns, and all of these genes were contained in the annotation information.\n",
      "The predicted intron accuracy rate of Sim4cc was 100%.\n",
      "On accuracy, Sim4cc was better than BLAT.\n",
      "If Sim4cc is used, the user has to splice a whole genome file to many files: one gene, one file.\n",
      "The computing process of Sim4cc was more complex than that of BLAT, and each time, Sim4cc only calculated one cDNA sequence to one gene sequence; so, the executing efficiency and speed are not high.\n",
      "In comparison, BLAT was easier and faster than Sim4cc.\n",
      "In conclusion, BLAT and Sim4cc can be used to predict introns, but each of them has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      "The comparative results are summarized in Table 5.\n",
      "Sim4cc was a cross-species spliced alignment program.\n",
      "In our study, Sim4cc was used to find introns by comparing cDNA sequences and gene sequences.\n",
      "The correct intron can be obtained by comparing one cDNA sequence with its own gene sequence.\n",
      "But, a lot of introns were lost by Sim4cc.\n",
      "In other words, Sim4cc was good at detecting the correct intron but not at predicting the whole number of introns in a genome.\n",
      "In contrast, BLAT can predict most of the introns - nearly all of the total introns in a genome.\n",
      "But, there were some false-positive predictions of introns.\n",
      "However, the proportion of this error was very small.\n",
      "As a result, BLAT will be proposed to annotate plant genome introns.\n",
      "Title: Intron length distribution of 10 plants\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Roy's method, many predicted introns in the plant genomes had in-frame stop codons, and the predicted introns in these genomes were equally as likely to be a multiple of 3 bp (3n) as to contain a plus one (3n + 1) or two (3n + 2) bp.\n",
      "Here was an example of three phases from an Arabidopsis thaliana gene, AT1G17600.1 (Fig.2).\n",
      "By analyzing genome sequence annotations, we got three-phase intron distributions for 10 plant species (Table 6).\n",
      "If the plant intron annotation is more accurate, the number of three phases should be similar (one-third each).\n",
      "For 80% (8/10) of species, there were similar numbers of the three phases.\n",
      "It should be noted that most of these plant species annotations were the best annotations to date, but new annotations will be continually released to correct errors and false-positive results.\n",

      "In contrast, the number of 3n introns varied much more widely, from 29.1% to 47.7%.\n",
      "In this study, two species' genome introns showed strongly skewed percentages, in that the 3n intron percentage was much lower or higher than the expected value (one-third).\n",

      "The green alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus has one of the highest gene densities known in eukaryotes, with many introns [28].\n",
      "There was a striking excess of predicted 3n introns (47.7% of all predicted introns, 1,130) compared to 3n + 1 (25.8%, 611) and 3n + 2 (26.5%, 628) introns.\n",
      "In this case, many predicted 3n introns were not true introns but instead exons.\n",
      "The unicellular green alga Ostreococcus tauri is the world's smallest free-living eukaryote known to date [29].\n",

      "This result is very close to previous studies [18].\n",

      "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material between kingdoms and is considered to play a positive role in adaptation.\n",
      "Cryptosporidium parvum is a parasitic protozoan that causes an infectious disease.\n",
      "Its genome sequencing reported 14 bacteria-like proteins in the nuclear genome.\n",
      "Among them, cgd2_1810, which has been annotated as CysQ, a sulfite synthesis pathway protein, is listed as one of the candidates of genes horizontally transferred from bacterial origin.\n",
      "In this report, we examined this issue using phylogenetic analysis.\n",
      "Our BLAST search showed that C. parvum CysQ protein had the highest similarity with that of proteobacteria.\n",
      "Analysis with NCBI's Conserved Domain Tree showed phylogenetic incongruence, in that C. parvum CysQ protein was located within a branch of proteobacteria in the cd01638 domain, a bacterial member of the inositol monophosphatase family.\n",
      "According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, the sulfate assimilation pathway, where CysQ plays an important role, is well conserved in most eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.\n",
      "However, the Apicomplexa, including C. parvum, largely lack orthologous genes of the pathway, suggesting its loss in those protozoan lineages.\n",
      "Therefore, we conclude that C. parvum regained cysQ from proteobacteria by HGT, although its functional role is elusive.\n",
      "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material between different species of interkingdom, and lateral gene transfer is for intrakingdom movement [1].\n",
      "The concept for gene transfer was first mentioned for an acquisition of virulence between bacterial strains [2], and then, transfers of multiple drug resistance between Shigellae and Escherichia coli strains were reported in Japan [3].\n",
      "It is important to note that HGT not only affects correct reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree but also helps to understand reasons of its occurrence.\n",
      "In bacteria, it is widely known that genetic material of antibiotic resistance is transferred in the gastrointestinal tract [4], and in the case of unicellular eukaryotes, such as Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histolytica, the organisms that use fermentation or anaerobic metabolism in the low-oxygen environment overcame the environmental stress by taking genes from bacteria [5].\n",
      "Moreover, the transferred gene plays a positive role in adaptation to a pathogenic way of life [6].\n",
      "On the other hand, HGT has been criticized, in that its biological significance is overemphasized.\n",
      "If a gene has an essential role and participates in many interactions, its transfer might be less likely to occur than that of others or would be detrimental to the recipient.\n",
      "Thus, some transferred genes are considered nonfunctional [7-9].\n",
      "Cryptosporidium is a parasitic protozoan of the phylum Apicomplexa.\n",
      "Among Cryptosporidium, C. parvum causes an infectious disease in humans and animals with diarrhea, called cryptosporidiosis.\n",
      "Although the disease is prevalent where water quality is poorly managed, there is no satisfactory treatment until now [10, 11].\n",
      "Genome sequencing of C. parvum was completed in 2004, identifying major metabolic pathways through comparison with other parasites and also reporting those enzymes with high similarities to bacterial and plantal counterparts [12].\n",
      "In some crucial biosynthesis pathways, C. parvum has enzymes that originated from various organisms, such as bacteria, plants, and algae.\n",
      "Phylogenomic analyses predicted a set of genes transferred from algae and eubacteria [13] and promising drug targets in nucleotide biosynthesis [14].\n",
      "However, among 14 bacterial-like enzymes that were reported by Abrahamsen et al., only two enzymes received follow-up attention [15, 16].CysQ, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase, also known as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 3'-phosphatase, or 3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, was among the 14 bacterial-like enzymes initially reported by the genome analysis.\n",
      "It has been thought that it is needed during aerobic growth in E. coli to help control the levels of PAPS in cysteine biosynthesis [17].\n",
      "Recently, CysQ protein has been considered as an important regulator that modulates the sulfate assimilation pathway by affecting levels of intermediates in plants, fungi, and bacteria [18, 19].\n",

      "This C. parvum gene was annotated \"CysQ, sulfite synthesis pathway protein.\"\n",
      "As no other components of the sulfate assimilation pathway, except for CysQ, are found in C. parvum, we may conclude that the pathway does not function in this organism.\n",
      "We compiled the orthologs of the genes in this pathway using the KO database (Table 1).\n",
      "Eukaryotic kingdoms, except for protists harbored full ranges of orthologs in all three classes.\n",
      "Animals and plants showed similar trends in Class I and II, because two classes shared two orthologs (K13811: 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase [PAPSS], K00955: bifunctional enzyme CysN/CysC [CysNC]), and even K13811 is specialized in animals and plants.\n",
      "Fungi also have many orthologs, like animals and plants, in Class I and II, but they have different orthologs (Class I, K00958, sulfate adenylyltransferase [E2.7.7.4C, met3]; Class II, K00860, adenylylsulfatekinase [CysC]).\n",
      "In prokaryotes, the proportion of Class I genes is higher than Class II.\n",
      "All Cyanobacteria, two-thirds of Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria contained one of the orthologs in Class I, whereas Firmicutes, other bacteria, and the Archaea group have a few orthologs in Class I, II, and III.\n",
      "On the other hand, there were very few orthologs of the sulfate assimilation pathway in protists.\n",
      "We expanded the protist lineage, cataloging the proteins at the class or species level (Table 2).\n",
      "Some protists (Choanoflagellates, Entamoeba of Amoebozoa, and Diatoms) had at least one orthologous gene in each of three classes, while most Alveolates, Amoeboflagellate, Euglenozoa, and Diplomonads did not have any orthologs in three classes, many of which are known as parasites causing infectious diseases.\n",
      "While the sulfate assimilation pathway is generally well conserved in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, in some protist lineages, the pathway is missing.\n",
      "Thus, we hypothesize that the pathway may have been lost during the evolution of the lineages.\n",
      "C. parvum, like other Aveolates, also may have lost it, and cge2_1810 can not function as CysQ properly.\n",
      "Its function remains elusive, as the sequence similarity to CysQ of M. tuberculosis or E. coli is rather low.\n",
      "A BLAST search of C. parvum CysQ (cgd2_1810) protein shows the highest similarity with those of proteobacteria.\n",
      "Although it implies HGT from bacteria to this eukaryote, sequence similarity alone is not enough as its basis for several known reasons [27].\n",
      "In addition, a phylogenetic analysis should support it.\n",
      "For this, initially, we relied on the tree built by PhylomeDB.\n",
      "However, its species coverage was biased or undersampled.\n",

      "C. parvum CysQ protein was mapped into the subfamily of IMPase, which is a bacterial CysQ domain, and comprises only bacterial sequences.\n",
      "Furthermore, C. parvum was located near Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria in the CDTree.\n",
      "Hence, it seems that these results demonstrate that gene transfer events occurred from bacteria to C. parvum in the evolutionary process.\n",
      "On the KEGG pathway, we raise the possibility that Alveolates, Euglenozoa, and Diplomonads of protozoa suffered from the losses of genes in the sulfate assimilation pathway.\n",
      "But, did C. parvum recover CysQ protein by HGT in the process of evolution?\n",
      "Sulfate assimilation shows highly conserved orthologs for each taxonomy lineage, and it plays important roles in sulfur metabolism, whereas Alveolates of protozoa, including Cryptosporidium, rarely have orthologous genes.\n",
      "For the pathogenic bacterium M. tuberculosis, sulfur-containing metabolites are essential to its pathogenesis and persistence in the host [18, 28], and the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) lists that Rv1286 (cysN) and Rv1285 (cysD), not Rv2131c (cysQ), are essential genes in sulfur metabolism of M. tuberculosis [29, 30].\n",
      "Parasitic protozoa have diverse sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism that are considered to affect virulence and several stress response.\n",
      "On the other hand, C. parvum and Plasmodium falciparum lack a sulfur assimilation pathway, which is expected to be substituted from host cells [31].\n",
      "In conclusion, although the sulfate assimilation pathway is missing in some protest lineages, C. parvum has a protein that is predicted as CysQ and has sequence similarity with that of proteobacteria, gram-negative bacteria.\n",
      "Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis supports the acquisition of cgd2_1810 from proteobacteria through horizontal gene transfer.\n",
      "Therefore, we can infer that C. parvum lost its genes in the sulfate assimilation pathway, including cysQ, during a parasitic way of life, and it acquired a copy of cysQ from bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.\n",
      "What is the biological role of this gene product?\n",

      "Among the 7 genetic variations, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported by American and Japanese researchers: non-synonymous SNP in exon 12 (rs1805124, A1673G-H558R) and synonymous SNP in exon 28 (rs1805126, C5457T-D1819D).\n",

      "This is the first case report with genetic variations of SCN5A in Korean patients with AVB.\n",
      "To date, a number of SCN5A variations associated with various cardiac diseases, such as LQT, Brs, progressive cardiac conduction defect, AF, and overlapping syndromes, have been reported.\n",
      "Although SCN5A genetic variations associated with AVB have been well studied in Caucasians, Han Chinese, and Japanese, no study has yet been published in Koreans as far we know.\n",
      "In previous studies, it has been shown that in some cases, progressive AVB has been linked to SCN5A gene variations [4].\n",
      "Furthermore, in our prior study, 2 novel variations were detected in Korean sick sinus syndrome (SSS) patients, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in any ethnic group.\n",
      "The variations could be significantly associated with functional effects of the SCN5A gene.\n",
      "Based on these results, we searched for SCN5A genetic variations in Korean AVB and compared them with those of control subjects.\n",
      "The SCN5A gene consists of 28 exons and encodes a protein of 2016 amino acids with a molecular mass of 227 kDa [7].\n",
      "In our patients with AVB, there were 7 sites of nucleotide change from exon 2 to exon 28 of the SCN5A gene.\n",
      "Among of them, 2 sites (G87A-A29A, IVS9-3C > A) were reported as genetic variations in a Western study [7], and T5457C-D1819D has already been reported as a variation or polymorphism without functional effects on the channel in Asian studies [7, 15, 16].\n",
      "A1673G-H558R is located in the Na+ channel I, II interdomain linker, and previous functional studies have shown that the H558R-encoding minor allele can alter the phenotype of true disease-causing SCN5A mutations [17].\n",
      "It has been suggested that it modulates Na+ channel functional changes caused by other variations and plays a role in intragenic complementation [18, 19].\n",
      "Previously, the H558R G allele has been associated with occurrence of early-onset AF and LQT interval in healthy populations.\n",
      "The H558R G allele frequency has been reported to be 20.4-32% in the white population, 29% in the black population, and 10.4% in the Chinese population.\n",
      "In our study, the G allele frequency of SCN5A mutation carriers was 8% and 13.1% in the normal control group.\n",
      "G3578A-R1193Q, which can cause a gain of the sodium ion channel function and cause LQT3 and Brs, was also found.\n",
      "It has been reported that G3578A-R1193Q confers a risk of LQT3 or Brs in the general population, although it seems to be a common polymorphism in the Han Chinese population.\n",
      "Electrophysiological studies showed that R1193Q destabilizes inactivation gating and generates a persistent, non-inactivating current, which results in a gain of the sodium channel function, as in LQT3 syndrome [20, 21].\n",
      "In addition to previously reported variations, we identified 2 novel variations that were not reported in the case of Japanese and Chinese populations.\n",
      "One of these variations was heterozygous non-synonymous (C48G-F16L), and the other was heterozygous synonymous (G3048A-T1016T).\n",
      "Since a non-synonymous nucleotide change in the SCN5A gene is likely to induce a functional change in the sodium channel, a non-synonymous substitution was considered a candidate for the variation associated with this disorder.\n",
      "In this study, a non-synonymous variation, C48G-F16L, was not found in the normal control group but was detected only in the patient group, suggesting that it may effect AVB.\n",
      "However, G298S [11], G514C [12], P1008S [13], G1406R [14], and D1595N [11], identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected, thought to be due to very low frequency or no variation in the Korean population.\n",
      "In summary, our data may provide useful information for the identification of novel variations related to AVB, and the novel variants may provide useful bio-markers to study Korean cardiac disease.\n",
      "In a future study, we will conduct a functional analysis of the novel variation (C48G-F16L) and propose a mechanism for its contribution to the AVB phenotype in patients.\n",

      "A sample size with sufficient statistical power is critical to the success of genetic association studies to detect causal genes of human complex diseases.\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies require much larger sample sizes to achieve an adequate statistical power.\n",
      "We estimated the statistical power with increasing numbers of markers analyzed and compared the sample sizes that were required in case-control studies and case-parent studies.\n",
      "We computed the effective sample size and statistical power using Genetic Power Calculator.\n",
      "An analysis using a larger number of markers requires a larger sample size.\n",
      "Testing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker requires 248 cases, while testing 500,000 SNPs and 1 million markers requires 1,206 cases and 1,255 cases, respectively, under the assumption of an odds ratio of 2, 5% disease prevalence, 5% minor allele frequency, complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), 1:1 case/control ratio, and a 5% error rate in an allelic test.\n",
      "Under a dominant model, a smaller sample size is required to achieve 80% power than other genetic models.\n",
      "We found that a much lower sample size was required with a strong effect size, common SNP, and increased LD.\n",
      "In addition, studying a common disease in a case-control study of a 1:4 case-control ratio is one way to achieve higher statistical power.\n",
      "We also found that case-parent studies require more samples than case-control studies.\n",
      "Although we have not covered all plausible cases in study design, the estimates of sample size and statistical power computed under various assumptions in this study may be useful to determine the sample size in designing a population-based genetic association study.\n",
      "In genetic epidemiological research, both case-control and case-parent trio designs have been used widely to evaluate genetic susceptibilities to human complex diseases and markers, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to localize disease gene variants [1-5].\n",
      "The sample size for detecting associations between disease and SNP markers is known to be highly affected by disease prevalence, disease allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium (LD), inheritance models (e.g., additive, dominant, and multiplicative models), and effect size of the genetic variants (e.g., odds ratio, relative risk, etc.)\n",
      "[4, 6, 7].\n",
      "Previous studies have shown that a population based case-control design can be more powerful than a family-based study design in identifying genes predisposing human complex traits, both for qualitative traits and for quantitative traits [8-11].\n",
      "However, some studies reported that the case-parent design is much more powerful than the case-control design in evaluating genetic risk for common complex diseases, because case-control studies are susceptible to bias due to phenotype misclassification or population stratification [12, 13].\n",
      "Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using thousands of cases and controls reported many susceptibility SNPs for 237 human traits by the end of June, 2011 (www.genome.gov/GWAStudies).\n",
      "Since a GWAS evaluates hundreds of thousands of SNP markers, it requires a much larger sample size to achieve an adequate statistical power [14-18].\n",
      "In genetic association studies, the observed signal for association is referred to be statistically significant if the p-value is less than a preset threshold value (α) of 0.05 to reject a null hypothesis of genetic association.\n",
      "Testing a large number of SNP markers leads to a large number of multiple comparisons and thus increases false positive rates.\n",
      "Either the Bonferroni correction or the false discovery rate is generally applied to avoid false positive (type I error) rates.\n",
      "However, the Bonferroni-corrected p-value, the significance threshold set to 0.05 divided by the total number of SNPs analyzed in a GWAS, is too strict to consider the correlations among SNP markers (e.g., p = 1 × 10-7 for 500,000 (500 K) SNPs, p = 5 × 10-8 for 1 million (M) SNPs) [16, 19].\n",
      "Therefore, estimating a sufficient sample size to achieve adequate statistical power is critical in the design stage of genetic association [20-24].\n",
      "Statistical power is the probability to reject a null hypothesis (H0) while the alternative hypothesis (HA) is true.\n",
      "It is affected by many factors.\n",
      "For instance, a larger sample size is required to achieve sufficient statistical power.\n",
      "Although a researcher collects a large number of samples, all samples may not be necessary to be analyzed to detect evidence for association.\n",
      "A large sample size improves the ability of disease prediction; however, it is not cost-effective that a researcher genotypes more than the effective sample size [25].\n",
      "Unless researchers estimate sample size and statistical power at the research design stage, it leads to wasted time and resources to collect samples.\n",
      "An effective sample size can be defined as the minimum number of samples that achieves adequate statistical power (e.g., 80% power).\n",
      "On the other hand, too small a sample size to detect true evidence for an association increases false negative rates and reduces the reliability of a study.\n",
      "False negative rates are increased by multiple factors that cause systematic biases, and such biases reduce statistical power [26].\n",
      "The statistical power of 80% is used widely to avoid false negative associations and to determine a cost-effective sample size in large-scale association studies [7, 22, 23].\n",
      "However, many researchers tend to overlook the importance of statistical power and sample size calculations.\n",
      "In this study, we evaluated statistical power with increasing numbers of markers analyzed under various assumptions and compared the sample sizes required in case-control studies and case-parent studies.\n",
      "We computed the effective sample size and statistical power using a web browser program, Genetic Power Calculator developed by Purcell et al.\n",
      "[27] (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/gpc/), for both case-control and case-parent studies.\n",
      "We conducted power and sample size calculations under various assumptions about genetic models (i.e., allelic, additive, dominant, recessive, and co-dominant models), minor allele frequencies (MAFs), pair-wise LD, disease prevalence, case-to-control ratio, and number of SNP markers (i.e., single SNP, 500 K SNPs, and 1 M SNPs).\n",
      "The values tested for heterozygous odds ratio (ORhet) were 1.3, 1.5, 2, and 2.5.\n",
      "The power and sample sizes were calculated under different ranges of factors, such as MAF of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%; LD of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1; disease prevalence of 0.01%, 0.1%, 5%, and 10%; and case-to-control ratio of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4.\n",
      "We assumed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the disease-susceptible allele.\n",
      "The Bonferroni p-value that was specific to the number of SNP makers tested was applied to cover 3 billion base pairs of the human genome (i.e., p = 0.05 for a single SNP marker, p = 1 × 10-7 for 500 K SNP markers, and p = 5 × 10-8 for 1 M SNP markers).\n",
      "We fixed the proper range of sample sizes from 100 to 2,000 cases, because the power is too low when the sample size is below 100 cases (or trios), and the cost is too high to realistically collect samples when the sample size is above 2,000 [7, 22].\n",
      "We calculated the sample size to achieve 80% statistical power according to the genetic models and the heterozygous ORs using a single SNP marker in a case-control study under the assumptions of 5% disease prevalence, 5% MAF, complete LD, 1:1 case-to-control ratio, and 5% type I error rate (α) (Table 1).\n",
      "The dominant model required the smallest sample size to achieve 80% power compared to other genetic models (e.g., 90 cases).\n",
      "In contrast, the effective sample size to test a single SNP under the recessive model was too large to collect with a limited budget, even if the homozygous OR is greater than 4 (e.g., 1,536 cases).\n",
      "It reveals difficulty in detecting a disease allele that follows a recessive mode of inheritance with a moderate sample size.\n",
      "The sample size and statistical power for the allelic test in a case-control study under the different assumptions of ORhet, MAF, disease prevalence, LD, and case-to-control ratio by allowing a 5% type I error rate are shown in Fig.1.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.1A, a lower sample size was required to test allelic association for a single SNP with a larger MAF at the same risk of disease (OR) under the assumptions of 5% disease prevalence, 5% α, complete LD, and 1:1 case-to-control ratio.\n",
      "The minimum number of cases decreased from 1,974 cases for a SNP with a MAF of 5% to 545 cases for a SNP with a MAF of 30% under the same assumption.\n",
      "A high-risk allele showing a high OR requires a smaller sample size to be detected under the same assumption.\n",
      "While an allele with an OR of 1.3 requires 1,974 cases and 1,974 controls to be significantly detected in a case-control study, a SNP with an OR of 2.5 can be detected in a study of 134 cases and 134 controls under the assumption of a MAF of 5%, disease prevalence of 5%, type I error rate of 5%, and D' of 1 (Fig.1A).\n",
      "The higher prevalence and the higher LD were associated with increased statistical power: for instance, as the LD increased from 0.4 to 0.6, 0.8, and 1, the statistical power obtained from a study of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls was obviously increased from 26.5% to 49.2%, 72.8%, and 88.4%, respectively, under the assumption of OR 1.3, 5% MAF, 5% prevalence, and 5% α level (Fig.1B and 1C).\n",
      "In addition, a 1:4 case-to-control ratio, which is the golden standard ratio for the numbers of cases and controls to be collected in a case-control study, showed the most effective sample size to achieve 80% statistical power.\n",
      "In many clinical settings, researchers are able to obtain more data from affected individuals than healthy individuals.\n",
      "On the other hand, there are more healthy participants than participants with a disease in a population-based study.\n",
      "Therefore, the minimum numbers of cases and controls required to achieve 80% statistical power depend on the study design.\n",
      "For a SNP with an allelic OR of 2 and 5% MAF, 127 cases and 508 controls are required in the case of a 1:4 case-control ratio, whereas 248 cases and 248 controls are required in the case of a 1:1 ratio to achieve 80% statistical power under the assumption of 5% prevalence, complete LD, and 5% α level.\n",
      "In Table 2, we compared the number of cases to the number of case-parent trios to perform a case-control study and a study using case-parent trios by increasing the number of SNPs being analyzed.\n",
      "Genetic association studies with larger numbers of SNP markers require a larger sample size to reduce false positive association due to testing multiple hypotheses.\n",
      "The sample size required in a case-parent study is generally larger than that of a case-control study design.\n",
      "For instance, 248 cases and 248 controls (496 individuals) were required to detect a SNP with an ORhet of 2 and 5% MAF in a case-control study, whereas 282 case-parent trios (846 individuals) were required under the assumption of 5% disease prevalence and complete LD by allowing a 5% α level.\n",
      "However, the sample sizes required in both study designs increase tremendously in a GWAS.\n",
      "Under the same assumptions as shown above, the number of samples increased from 248 cases for a single SNP analysis to 1,206 cases and 1,255 cases for analyses of 500 K SNPs and 1 M SNPs, respectively, based on the threshold of p-value, calculated using a strict Bonferroni correction for multiple hypotheses comparisons.\n",
      "The statistical power to test the same number of subjects was higher for the case-control design than for the case-parent trio design (Fig.2).\n",
      "Both designs of the case-control study and case-parent study are used widely in the field of genetic epidemiology for studying associations between genetic factors and the risk of disease.\n",
      "Over the past 2 decades, there has been a steep increase in the number of genetic association studies, and these studies have successfully reported a number of gene variants associated with human complex diseases [1, 4, 5, 28].\n",
      "Recently, GWASs, a new frontier in genetic epidemiology, have identified thousands of new gene variants related to human diseases [29].\n",
      "The population-based studies with a large sample size have increased statistical power, which leads to smaller variance.\n",
      "However, it requires too much money and takes too long to collect a sufficient number of samples, and these large-scale studies are more likely to be affected by systematic bias and noise [25, 30].\n",
      "In the current study, we demonstrated the effective sample sizes that are required to achieve 80% statistical power for a case-control study and case-parent study separately under various assumptions regarding effect size, MAF, disease prevalence, LD, case-to-control ratio, and number of SNPs.\n",
      "A lower sample size is required under the dominant model in any assumption, while the recessive model requires too many samples under the same assumptions to achieve adequate statistical power.\n",
      "Further, we confirmed that a lower sample size is required for testing more common SNPs with stronger effect sizes and increased LD between marker allele and disease allele.\n",
      "A lower sample size is required to study a common disease than a rare disease.\n",
      "The statistical power increases by increasing the number of controls per case; however, a case-to-control ratio exceeding 1:4 does not yield a significant increase in statistical power.\n",
      "Among the parameters tested, under the assumption of a high level of LD between a marker and disease variant, a much reduced sample size is needed to detect evidence for association.\n",
      "Common variants are more informative than rare variants in LD-based indirect association studies on complex diseases.\n",
      "It means that researchers can reduce the cost by choosing common variants to be genotyped at the design stage of an LD-based association study.\n",
      "In general, the case-control study design is more powerful than the case-parent study design [8, 10].\n",
      "Since patients with family histories of the disease are more likely to inherit disease-predisposing alleles than patients without family histories of the disease, researchers can improve the statistical power by sampling patients with affected relatives and by comparing to controls without any family history in case-control association studies [13].\n",
      "Genome-wide case-control studies have been used to identify genetic variants that predispose to human disease with model assumptions for parameters, such as the inheritance model.\n",
      "Such studies are powerful in detecting common variants with moderate effect in the occurrence of a disease; however, a study with a large number of SNP markers by using 500 K or 1 million chips requires a large number of samples (e.g., thousands of cases and controls) to achieve adequate statistical power.\n",
      "A researcher can rarely successfully conduct a large-scale association study without collaboration using a high-throughput microarray chip, in which most embedded SNPs reveal a small effect size between 1.3 and 1.6 [31].\n",
      "Therefore, researchers who are planning a genetic association study must calculate the effective sample size and the statistical power in the design phase to perform a cost-effective study that reduces false negative and false positive test results.\n",

      "Gene set analysis (GSA) is useful in interpreting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) result in terms of biological mechanism.\n",
      "We compared the performance of two different GSA implementations that accept GWAS p-values of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or gene-by-gene summaries thereof, GSA-SNP and i-GSEA4GWAS, under the same settings of inputs and parameters.\n",
      "GSA runs were made with two sets of p-values from a Korean type 2 diabetes mellitus GWAS study: 259,188 and 1,152,947 SNPs of the original and imputed genotype datasets, respectively.\n",
      "When Gene Ontology terms were used as gene sets, i-GSEA4GWAS produced 283 and 1,070 hits for the unimputed and imputed datasets, respectively.\n",
      "On the other hand, GSA-SNP reported 94 and 38 hits, respectively, for both datasets.\n",
      "Similar, but to a lesser degree, trends were observed with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) gene sets as well.\n",
      "The huge number of hits by i-GSEA4GWAS for the imputed dataset was probably an artifact due to the scaling step in the algorithm.\n",
      "The decrease in hits by GSA-SNP for the imputed dataset may be due to the fact that it relies on Z-statistics, which is sensitive to variations in the background level of associations.\n",
      "Judicious evaluation of the GSA outcomes, perhaps based on multiple programs, is recommended.\n",
      "Gene set analysis (GSA) is useful in understanding the biological mechanisms underneath a phenotype by assessing the overall evidence of association of variations in an entire set of genes with a disease or a quantitative trait.\n",
      "GSA has recently been used to investigate many common diseases as an approach for the secondary analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) result [1-3].\n",
      "Currently, several software tools for GSA are available: GSA-SNP [4], i-GSEA4GWAS [5], GSEA-SNP [6], GeSBAP [7], and so on.\n",
      "GSA-SNP is useful only when p-values of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are available.\n",
      "While GSA-SNP has implemented several options for estimating the significance of a gene set, its implementation of Z-statistics may be the most convenient.\n",
      "Other methods require permuted p-values that are obtained from sample permutation trials; this requires lengthy computation runs.\n",
      "The Z-statistics method accepts only one set of unpermuted original p-values and compares the score of a gene set against the background distribution made by all the genes; these p-values should be readily available for a typical GWAS.\n",
      "Similarly, i-GSEA4GWAS also uses only the original set of p-values and thus is as convenient as GSA-SNP.\n",
      "Instead of sample permutation, it estimates the significance of a gene set via SNP permutation [8].\n",
      "One of its unique features is a scaling step that emphasizes the gene sets that are enriched with strongly associated genes.\n",
      "Often, these approaches give different results in terms of the number of gene set hits.\n",
      "Hence, we compared these two methods using the same dataset while controlling the input parameters as much as possible.\n",

      "For both databases, only the gene sets having 10-200 member genes were used (3534 GO and 211 KEGG terms).\n",
      "For both GSA-SNP and i-GSEA4GWAS, 20-kb padding was added to both ends of each gene.\n",
      "Usually, these methods, like i-GSEA4GWAS, pick up the best p-value and assign it to the encompassing gene.\n",
      "On the contrary, GSA-SNP allows one to choose different schemes for assigning the SNP p-values to each gene: either the best or the second best p-value within the gene boundary.\n",
      "Choosing the second best p-value has been recommended, as it may reduce the false positive associations with little loss of sensitivity [4].\n",
      "For GSA-SNP, we downloaded the standalone program (as of Jan. 2011) and executed it locally.\n",
      "For i-GSEA4GWAS, we used the web server version by uploading the SNP p-values.\n",
      "GSA-SNP allows several approaches of evaluating gene set significance.\n",
      "While other approaches require p-values from permutation tests, Z-standardization requires no permuted p-values.\n",
      "The score of a gene is defined as -log of the p-value assigned to the gene.\n",
      "For each gene set, the scores of its member genes are averaged, and the Z-statistics of these scores are used to estimate the significance under the assumption of a normal distribution.\n",
      "The effect of multiple testing is corrected by the false discovery rate (FDR) method [13].\n",
      "On the other hand, i-GSEA4GWAS compares the distribution of the member gene scores of a gene set to all the genes using K-S statistics and corrects the multiple testing effect using FDR that is based on SNP permutation tests.\n",
      "Variation in the number of member genes among gene sets is taken care of by multiplying a ratio of 'highly significant' genes in a gene set relative to those among all genes.\n",
      "Here, the 'highly significant' genes are defined as the genes that map with at least one of the top 5% of all SNPs in the dataset.\n",
      "The performance of GSA-SNP and i-GSEA4GWAS looked quite different in terms of the number of hits (Table 1).\n",
      "GSA-SNP detected 27-94 hits for either the imputed or unimputed genotype dataset with GO gene sets, while 9-20 hits were detected with KEGG gene sets.\n",
      "Consistently, more gene sets were hit with the scheme of using the second-best p-value of a gene than the best one.\n",
      "Previously, it has been recommended that one assign the second-best, not the best, p-value to a gene due to a concern that the use of the best p-values of a gene may produce more false positives than the second-best one [4].\n",
      "We compared the distribution of gene scores that were calculated based on the best and the second-best p-values using a high-volume scatter plot that represented the local density of points by a false color representation (Fig.1).\n",
      "One may notice the densely populated points along the diagonal axis, meaning that the differences in gene scores were small for the majority of genes.\n",
      "Nevertheless, there were many genes off-diagonal; for these genes, the gene scores that were calculated with the best p-values were larger than those calculated with the second-best p-values.\n",
      "While this effect was negligible for the genes having high scores (p < 10-4), many genes having low scores displayed large differences.\n",
      "The latter were genes that had only one SNP within its boundary plus 20 kb of padding standing out in terms of significance and the rest falling short.\n",
      "If the best SNP of a gene had been located within a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, the second-best SNP would have been chosen from this block with a p-value close to the best one.\n",
      "On the other hand, if the best SNP is in weak LD with the second-best one, they would differ from each other considerably.\n",
      "Considering that Fig.1 was based on the highly densely imputed genotypes, those genes that showed a large difference may have been located within narrow LD blocks or recombination hot spots where imputation may be invalid.\n",
      "Indeed, the genes that were not located within haplotype blocks showed larger differences in gene scores than those located within haplotype blocks (Supplementary Fig.1).\n",
      "For those genes located within haplotype blocks, there were inverse relationships between the block size and the difference in gene scores (Supplementary Fig.2).\n",
      "It is also possible that the apparent associations seen with the best p-values may have been due to random errors; assigning the second-best p-value to a gene may then reduce false associations.\n",
      "One may argue that the large difference between the best and second-best scores for some genes may be due to the small number of SNPs for those genes.\n",
      "If this is the case, there should be an inverse relationship between these two quantities.\n",
      "As shown in Supplementary Fig.3, there is no such evidence.\n",
      "Here is the rationale for the more hits made by GSA-SNP with the use of the second-best p-values than the best p-values in assigning them to a gene.\n",
      "GSA-SNP assigns a score to a gene set by averaging gene scores (-logP) of its member genes and calculates Z-statistic by subtracting the mean of all gene scores from the gene set score.\n",
      "Assigning the second-best p-value to a gene produces lower gene scores than assigning the best one.\n",
      "While this effect is more pronounced with low-scoring genes, the high-scoring genes suffer little.\n",
      "Since the mean of all gene scores would also decrease by using the second-best p-values compared to the use of the best p-values, the resulting Z-statistic for a gene set that is composed of high-scoring genes would then increase, yielding more hits.\n",
      "The GSA-SNP runs with p-values of the imputed genotypes consistently produced fewer hits than with those of the unimputed genotypes.\n",
      "Imputation guesses the genotype of an untyped marker and fills it in.\n",
      "The GWAS p-value of an imputed SNP can be either larger or smaller than those of the neighboring genotyped, unimputed ones.\n",
      "For the former cases, it would not change the best p-value that is assigned to a gene.\n",
      "On the other hand, for the latter cases, the best p-value that is assigned to a gene can get smaller.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.2, the imputation increased the significance of many genes.\n",
      "This has the effect of reducing the number of hits for the GSA-SNP runs with the imputed dataset compared with the unimputed one, similar to the argument given above for the schemes of assigning the best or second-best p-values to a gene.\n",
      "With the p-values of the imputed SNPs, i-GSEA4GWAS claimed 1,070 GO terms as significant, almost 40-fold more than GSA-SNP, which yielded only 27 terms.\n",
      "Even with the p-values of the original unimputed SNPs, i-GSEA4GWAS produced about 4.6 times more terms than GSA-SNP (283 vs. 61).\n",
      "It appears that i-GSEA4GWAS unrealistically produced too many hits (about 1/3 of the input GO terms), hampered by the high proportion of false positives.\n",
      "This trend was much more pronounced with GO than KEGG, probably due to the more redundant nature of GO than KEGG.\n",
      "Unlike GSA-SNP, which reported fewer hits with the imputed dataset than the unimputed one, i-GSEA4GWAS produced about 5 times more hits with the former than the latter.\n",
      "Why did i-GSEA4GWAS perform even more poorly with the imputed dataset that should be more ideal in terms of marker density than the unimputed one?\n",
      "i-GSEA4GWAS assigns the best p-value to a gene and evaluates the gene set score by comparing the distribution of gene scores (-logP) of a gene set to that of all gene scores.\n",
      "The significance of the gene set score is estimated by the FDR, which compares the unpermuted distribution of the gene set scores with that of the gene set scores generated from a number of SNPpermuted datasets.\n",
      "The gene set score is multiplied by a factor, k/K, where k represents the proportion of so-called 'significant' genes within the gene set and K represents the proportion of 'significant' genes of all genes.\n",
      "i-GSEA4GWAS defines the 'significant' genes as those that are mapped with at least one 'top 5%' SNP.\n",
      "This step is a unique feature of i-GSEA4GWAS, which has the prefix 'i' in its name.\n",
      "Generally, an imputed dataset has much higher marker density than the corresponding unimputed one (4.45-fold difference in our case).\n",
      "The so-called 'top 5%' SNPs will be more with the imputed dataset than the unimputed one (again, a 4.45-fold difference in our case).\n",
      "This corresponded to p-value cutoff of 0.047 in our case.\n",
      "The number of so-called 'significant' genes does not increase as much as the increase in the marker density: from 2,967 genes for the unimputed dataset to 4,156 genes for the imputed one in our case.\n",
      "The concept of augmenting gene set scores by the proportion of 'significant' genes may be useful, as demonstrated previously in comparison with GSEA [5, 14].\n",
      "However, the 'top 5%' threshold used by i-GSEA4GWAS may be too high, inflating the false positive rates.\n",
      "This inflation may be more pronounced with an imputed dataset - 1,000 more genes were treated as 'significant' with our imputed dataset than with the unimputed one.\n",
      "Probably, this is one of the main reasons for the particularly poor performance of i-GSEA4GWAS with the imputed dataset.\n",
      "GSA is useful method in interpreting the result from a GWAS.\n",
      "A systematic evaluation of its performance is of paramount interest to the GWAS community, as the method is getting popular.\n",
      "Here, we compared the performance of two such methods using the common datasets and gene set databases.\n",
      "While GSA-SNP behaved predictably, i-GSEA4GWAS produced too many hits for most of the test settings.\n",
      "For example, i-GSEA4GWAS reported 3.8- and 6.5-fold more hits, respectively, for GO and KEGG, with the imputed dataset than with the unimputed one.\n",
      "Imputation is such a useful practice that augments the power of a genotype dataset, and ideally, gene set analyses can benefit from it.\n",
      "Our study warns that one must be cautious in applying i-GSEA4GWAS to an imputed dataset.\n",
      "As we pinpointed above concerning the 'top 5%' threshold as the potential cause of the high hit rates of i-GSEA4GWAS, it would be interesting to re-evaluate its performance with lower thresholds.\n",
      "Currently, the threshold is not available for the users to change it.\n",
      "It would have been better if the user could choose it at will.\n",
      "For GSA-SNP, we recommend using an imputed dataset if at all possible.\n",
      "GSA-SNP allows the user to choose k in assigning the k-th best p-value to a gene.\n",
      "We recommend using k = 2 instead of k = 1, as the latter inflates the scores for some genes, diminishing the power of GSA.\n",

      "The Tanimoto coefficients between histamine and other ligand molecules are shown in Table 2.\n",
      "Typically, a Tanimoto coefficient > 0.85 is considered highly similar, and a coefficient > 0.75 is considered similar for the purpose of clustering molecules that may have similar biological activity profiles [15].\n",
      "The highest Tanimoto coefficient among agonists was 0.45 (imetit), and this is not high enough to be considered a molecule that has potential agonist efficacy.\n",
      "Moreover, the lowest value of Tanimoto coefficient among agonists was 0.08 (dimaprit and SKF91488) and is also a lower value as an antagonist.\n",
      "It seems that there is no related pattern between Tanimoto coefficients and the functional types of molecules in the case of histamine receptor agonists or antagonists.\n",
      "To search for a novel characteristic for the classification of histamine receptor ligands, a kind of molecular calculation using agglomerative hierarchical clustering was adopted in this work.\n",
      "The result of the hierarchical clustering of the similarity matrix from CIMVF is shown in Fig.2.\n",
      "As shown in the figure, eight agonists were located nearby (the part in the dotted circle), except impromidine, and all antagonists were clustered close to each other in the radial tree.\n",
      "We can tell the regional difference between agonists and antagonists in the tree and also find that the information from the molecular vibrational frequency may play a role in the classification of agonists/antagonists for histamine receptor as a possible molecular descriptor.\n",
      "For these methods, clustering with CIMVF shows the more proper result in the case of histamine receptor ligands.\n",

      "The explosive development of genomics technologies including microarrays and next generation sequencing (NGS) has provided comprehensive maps of cancer genomes, including the expression of mRNAs and microRNAs, DNA copy numbers, sequence variations, and epigenetic changes.\n",
      "These genome-wide profiles of the genetic aberrations could reveal the candidates for diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers as well as mechanistic insights into tumor development and progression.\n",
      "Recent efforts to establish the huge cancer genome compendium and integrative omics analyses, so-called \"integromics\", have extended our understanding on the cancer genome, showing its daunting complexity and heterogeneity.\n",
      "However, the challenges of the structured integration, sharing, and interpretation of the big omics data still remain to be resolved.\n",
      "Here, we review several issues raised in cancer omics data analysis, including NGS, focusing particularly on the study design and analysis strategies.\n",
      "This might be helpful to understand the current trends and strategies of the rapidly evolving cancer genomics research.\n",
      "In the last decade, numerous genomic studies have addressed the enormous complexity of the cancer genome.\n",
      "Genomic profiling using microarray technology could stratify the tumors into homogeneous subgroups, providing novel clinical insights for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics as well as systematic views on the underlying mechanisms of tumor progression.\n",
      "In addition to the microarray technologies, explosive advances on sequencing technologies have been made recently, which is called \"next generation sequencing (NGS).\"\n",
      "Compared to the previous DNA sequencing of the Sanger method using dideoxynucleotide termination reaction termed as \"first-generation\" sequencing, NGS uses massively parallel sequencing method generating hundreds of millions of short (~200 bp) DNA reads, which can sequence a human genome rapidly with extremely lower cost.\n",
      "The earlier NGS method with the single-end read sequencing inevitably produces the short-read problems, limiting the accuracy of genome alignment.\n",
      "This could be improved by applying a paired-end sequencing method, allowing substantial advances in identifying not only point mutations but also genomic rearrangements, such as deletions, amplifications, inversions, translocations, and gene-fusions [1, 2].\n",
      "The NGS technology is now divided into \"second generation sequencing\" and \"third generation sequencing.\"\n",
      "The second generation sequencing refers to the strategies of short-read alignment, while the rapidly being developed technology of the third generation sequencing refers to the single DNA molecule based sequencing.\n",
      "The third generation method has advantage of less amount of DNA input that allows the emerging field of single cell sequencing [3].\n",
      "Moreover, there is no step for PCR amplification, therefore, the nucleotide incorporation errors can be handled.\n",
      "However, all the platforms of NGS technologies still have limitations in accurate base calling and alignment.\n",
      "The errors are likely to be platform-dependent, which increases the complexity of the data analysis.\n",
      "Therefore, the cost for bioinformatic analysis, rather than the sequencing itself continues to grow, which is referred to as \"the $1,000 genomes, the $100,000 analysis\" problem [4].\n",
      "The application of Exome-Seq and Whole Genome-Seq profiled a mutational spectrum in various cancers [5-8].\n",
      "The RNA-Seq could profile not only the gene expressions but also new parameters such as allelic expression, alternative splicing [9, 10], RNA-editing [11], and alternative polyadenylation of 3'-untranaslated region (3'-UTR) [12, 13].\n",
      "Structural variations such as gene-fusions, e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer [14] and KIF5B-RET in lung cancer [15] have been identified from the analysis of NGS data.\n",
      "Moreover, the patterns of genome rearrangements can be analyzed systematically.\n",
      "For example, a novel pattern of genomic rearrangement such as fold-back inversion could be found by simply examining the short read alignment of NGS data [16].\n",
      "A novel mechanism of cancer genome rearrangement i.e., chromothripsis has been proposed, which represent a catastrophic event of fragmentation and reassembly of a single chromosome [17].\n",
      "In addition, high-resolution epigenomic profiles of cancer genome could be obtained by applying NGS to chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq).\n",
      "For example, a recent study of the genome-wide DNA methylation profile showed novel patterns in which the majority of DNA methylation changes occurs at CpG island shores neighboring the regions up to 2 Kb from CpG islands, and revealed the patterns of cancer-specific and tissue-specific DNA methylation [18, 19].\n",
      "Aberrant histone modification was also found in cancers showing an association with the patient's prognosis [20].\n",
      "These studies support the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation in cancer development and progression.\n",
      "Moving forward, new applications such as genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) [21] and translocation capture sequencing (TC-Seq) [22] have recently been proposed, which could profile the genome-wide translocation hotspots.\n",
      "Notably, the advantage of NGS is not restricted to these applications.\n",
      "It serves a platform for the identification of novel RNAs or DNAs.\n",
      "For example, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from intergenic and intronic regions have been identified in prostate cancers i.e., prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) [23].\n",
      "A novel class of DNA i.e., extrachromosomal microDNA, has been recently found by NGS technology, which is derived from unique non-repetitive sequence enriched in 5'-UTR, exons, and CpG islands [24].\n",
      "The role of microDNA in cancer will be the next question.\n",
      "Title: Challenges in cancer genomics\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary study goals of cancer genomics are not simple, which include the studies to get either clinical or mechanistic insights from the cancer genome.\n",
      "To clarify the complicated study designs and strategies of cancer genomics, we have categorized the gene signatures obtained from cancer genome data into four classes prediction, phenotype, function, and molecular targets based on the study goals [25].\n",
      "The majority of the previous studies have suggested the translational or clinical utility of the genomics data by addressing the candidate biomarkers or the prediction signatures for predicting patients clinical outcomes, such as recurrence, survival, metastasis, or response to therapies.\n",
      "Notwithstanding the overwhelming identification of candidate biomarkers from the cancer genome, only a handful of candidate biomarkers that have been discovered from genomic analyses can succeed in the validation of the clinical utility [18].\n",
      "There are several challenges in cancer genomics that preclude clinical utility.\n",
      "One of them would be data reproducibility.\n",
      "They might be due in part to the experimental biases as well as sample cohort issues.\n",
      "The use of different platforms measuring gene expressions and different data processing methods could produce biased observation in each study.\n",
      "Increasing sample size will be one of the solutions to find proper biomarkers, overcoming the reproducibility problem.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, large-scale sample collection provides increased statistical power.\n",
      "However, previous studies, even with large sample sizes, have often failed to reproduce their findings in independent studies [26].\n",
      "This might be due mostly to the use of different protocols and analysis methods.\n",
      "Moreover, biased sample collection may also affect the performance of prognostic biomarkers, leading to subsequent failure to validate the biomarker in another patient population [27].\n",
      "For example, diagnostic biomarkers must be discovered in early-stage tumors; however, the sample collection of early tumors with enough of a sample size might be difficult in the clinical setting [18, 28].\n",
      "In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the sample size enrolled in a study should be considered.\n",
      "Simply increasing the sample size might not be the best solution.\n",
      "The sample sources and qualities are also important factors to be considered in the study design.\n",
      "For example, circulating DNAs or microRNAs in the plasma or urine can be used to develop \"noninvasive\" biomarkers in cancer patients, which might bring the technology much closer to the clinic [29, 30].\n",
      "Attempts to use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues might also be more applicable to the clinic [31], although the quality and the quantity of the DNAs or RNA extracts from FFPE or plasma are still problematic for genomics studies requesting further elaboration.\n",
      "Title: Dissecting the tumor heterogeneity\n",
      "\n",
      "The data complexity comes not only from the heterogeneous or biased sample composition, but also from the innate complexity of tumor biology.\n",
      "Previously, mounting evidence has shown the enormous heterogeneity of tumors at the molecular level.\n",
      "The tumor heterogeneity can be explained by two hypothetical models.\n",
      "One is the clonal segregation model with a multi-step process, and the other is the cancer stem cell theory.\n",
      "The cancer stem cell model describes the heterogeneous cellular origin of cancers from primitive progenitor cells to mature differentiated cells, which may contribute to tumor heterogeneity.\n",
      "In this context, genomic profiling studies could define the cancer subpopulation harboring stem-like traits in various cancer types, supporting the cancer stem cell theory [32, 33].\n",
      "Similarly, we also defined the bilineal trait in a subpopulation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing the gene expression profiles of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) [34].\n",
      "This result showed the continuous liver cancer spectrum between HCC and CC, suggesting that stem-like or de-differentiation traits may give rise to the heterogeneous progression of HCC.\n",
      "We also suggested that the dysfunction of p53 machinery is associated with the acquisition of the stemness trait in HCC [35].\n",
      "Recently, this association could be validated by showing p53 knockout mouse model can give rise to bilineal liver cancers [36].\n",
      "In addition, various host factors may contribute to tumor heterogeneity.\n",
      "Interactions of the tumor cells with host eco-system, such as innate immune systems, or the reactions of surrounding microenvironment against the tumor may affect the tumor behaviors [37].\n",
      "Thus, the proper detection of biomarkers might be difficult without considering the effect of host factors.\n",
      "Furthermore, the intratumoral heterogeneity of cancers have been notified in detail by genome-wide sequencing of multi-loci from the same tumor [38].\n",
      "The comparison of primary and metastatic tumors by single cell sequencing also revealed the sequential mutation process during cancer progression [39].\n",
      "Similarly, the comparison of mutations from multiple HCC tumors in the same patient could define the evolutionary lineage among tumors cells [40].\n",
      "Strikingly, the development of single-cell sequencing technology could provide a more detailed and systematic view on intra-tumoral heterogeneity [41, 42].\n",
      "Of interest, such attempts enabled the construction of phylogenic trees from mutational heterogeneity, which revealed evolutionary tumor growth opening a new field of \"cancer evolution\".\n",
      "Title: Returning to biology for clinical utility\n",
      "\n",
      "As discussed above, there are many factors contributing to tumor heterogeneity, which may impede the discovery of new biomarkers.\n",
      "Thus, we are now urgently in need of developing new strategies for biomarker discovery from cancer genome data.\n",
      "Considering the huge complexity of the cancer genome and the limitation of current technologies, it would be a reliable strategy to evaluate the functional relevance of the candidate biomarkers rather than simply showing the statistical significance of the association by enrolling larger samples or applying more stringent statistics.\n",
      "Although the conventional strategies for biomarker discovery do not require the functional significance of the candidates [43], current hurdles in cancer genomics request a functional validation step in the pipeline of the biomarker discovery.\n",
      "Our limited understanding of the complexity of cancer biology is a significant challenge for translational interpretation of the cancer genome.\n",
      "Title: Challenges of big data issues and integromics\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, systematic structuring and integration of multiple and multi-layered omics data resources, i.e.\n",
      "integromics, are thought of a state-of-the-art strategy.\n",
      "The recent establishment of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) could accelerate and facilitate the integration and sharing of cancer genome data [44].\n",
      "Multi-layered integromics could define tumor heterogeneity, revealing pivotal aberrations of genetic events or signaling pathways [45].\n",
      "In parallel, genomic repositories for drug activities have been established [46-48].\n",
      "Linking the profiles of drug sensitivity to the cancer genome could provide a powerful platform to guide rational and personalized cancer therapeutics.\n",
      "Now, as genomic data are increasing and accumulating enormously, new study designs and analysis strategies for integromics might be required, particularly with the context of tumor heterogeneity and the discovery of the functional biomarkers.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.1, the first step in cancer integromics is the dissection of tumor heterogeneity.\n",
      "Then, the next step will be a recapitulation of the relations between clinical/biological phenotypes and molecular genotypes in cancer subpopulations, which can address novel functionalities in particular subpopulations of cancers.\n",
      "We suggest that the discovery of reliable candidate functional biomarkers as well as functional genetic alterations, so-called \"driver events\", can be achieved through performing this step-by-step evaluation of both clinical and functional utilities.\n",
      "This hybrid study design would open an exciting era for developing new \"functional biomarkers\" and preventive/therapeutic strategies with the consideration of biological backgrounds of tumor heterogeneity.\n",
      "We briefly reviewed the current challenges and perspectives of integrative cancer genomics, focusing particularly on the complexity of omics data and cancer biology.\n",
      "Integromic approaches with functional evaluation should be considered even for clinical as well as mechanistic applications of cancer genome data.\n",
      "Necessarily, the challenges of big data (particularly the NGS platforms) and integromics should be considered in the study design.\n",
      "A deep understanding of both cancer biology and omics data characteristics is necessarily required for successful cancer genome analysis.\n",
      "Moving forward, it is clear that progress will come through large-scale, wide-scope, and multi-disciplinary collaborations and sharing systems, which will accelerate the realization of translational and personalized medicine in the near future.\n",

      "Title: Alternative Splicing and Its Impact as a Cancer Diagnostic Marker\n",
      "\n",
      "Most genes are processed by alternative splicing for gene expression, resulting in the complexity of the transcriptome in eukaryotes.\n",
      "It allows a limited number of genes to encode various proteins with intricate functions.\n",
      "Alternative splicing is regulated by genetic mutations in cis-regulatory factors and epigenetic events.\n",
      "Furthermore, splicing events occur differently according to cell type, developmental stage, and various diseases, including cancer.\n",
      "Genome instability and flexible proteomes by alternative splicing could affect cancer cells to grow and survive, leading to metastasis.\n",
      "Cancer cells that are transformed by aberrant and uncontrolled mechanisms could produce alternative splicing to maintain and spread them continuously.\n",
      "Splicing variants in various cancers represent crucial roles for tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Taken together, the identification of alternative spliced variants as biomarkers to distinguish between normal and cancer cells could cast light on tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Genes are transcribed into pre-mRNA and pass through splicing as a post-transcriptional modification to generate mature mRNA for translation [1].\n",
      "Splicing is an essential process for gene expression in eukaryotes, eliminating introns and joining the exons, which occurs in the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins [2].\n",
      "This splicing can generate alternative spliced transcripts from pre-mRNA and different exon constitutions, resulting in different proteins.\n",
      "Alternative splicing can occur in different ways.\n",
      "The most representative mechanisms are as follows: 1, extending or shortening the exon by alternative donor and acceptor sites; 2, exon skipping; 3, mutual exon exclusion; and 4, intron retention [1, 3, 4].\n",
      "These mechanisms allow protein isoforms with different biological characters to be produced from single genes [1].\n",
      "Therefore, complex transcriptomes and proteomes could be derived from a limited number of genes [4].\n",
      "Namely, this process is an important strategy for the complicated regulation of eukaryotes, and most genes (92-95%) undergo this process [5, 6].\n",
      "Alternative splicing is regulated according to cell type, developmental stage, and disease states [1, 7, 8].\n",
      "Biochemical mechanisms for the recognition of splice sites are not understood clearly according to cellular conditions, but some tissue-specific factors participate in alternative splicing [4].\n",
      "In addition, quantitative gene expression is controlled by nonsense-mediated decay mechanisms that degrade targeting mRNAs, producing nonsense mutations.\n",
      "Thus, truncated or erroneous proteins with abnormal functions are prevented from being expressed [9].\n",
      "Alternative transcripts could be related to various diseases, including cancer.\n",
      "As many as 50% of genetic diseases of humans are related to mutations in splice site sequences and regulatory elements, such enhancers and silencers, resulting in alternative exon constitution [3, 10, 11].\n",
      "Recently, the SpliceDisease database, providing information for relationships among gene mutation, splicing defects, and diseases, was reported [12].\n",
      "Especially, aberrent spliced variants are found frequently in cancer, indicating that they could play a role for the survival of cancer cells [8].\n",
      "Alternative splicing of cancer-related genes could affect cell cycle control, signal transduction pathways, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [8, 13].\n",
      "Cancer markers allow us to determine the prognosis and therapy for cancer during the remedy of cancer.\n",
      "Thus, the identification of cancer markers is highlighted in the cancer research field [14].\n",
      "Cancers result from the accumulation of complex genetic and epigenetic alterations against normal regulation.\n",
      "Cancerous cells grow irregularly, create malignant tumors, and move to the other parts of the body.\n",
      "Their alternative spliced transcripts could be detected with cryptic splicing sites.\n",
      "Accordingly, alternative transcripts produced by splicing events represent good candidates for cancer biomarkers [7, 8, 13].\n",
      "In the present review, we summarize and discuss the alternative splicing events and their potential as cancer biomarkers.\n",
      "Alternative splicing is an essential post-transcriptional process for creating various protein isoforms from the same gene.\n",
      "Approximately 60% of human genes have at least one alternative splice transcript [15].\n",
      "Alternative splicing is regulated by mutations in genetic regions [3, 7, 14].\n",
      "Most exons are flanked by the intronic dinucleotides GT (donor site) and AG (acceptor site), which are recognized by the spliceosome (Fig.1A).\n",
      "Pre-mRNA is reconstructed only by joined exons with the removal of introns.\n",
      "However, mutations of these splice sites lead to aberrant splicing, producing exon skipping and different joining of exons to truncated or nonfunctional or dysfunctional proteins.\n",
      "It was reported that mutations of splice sites may play important roles in human disease, and longer proteins also tend to associate to various disease [16, 17].\n",
      "In the case of the PAX6 gene, a 5' splice site mutation in intron 12 induces exon skipping in relation to autosomal dominant aniridia [18].\n",
      "In the APC gene, abnormal splicing by a 3' splice site mutation in intron 3 causes exon 4 skipping due to a frameshift in hepatoblastoma [19].\n",
      "A mutation in intron 25 of the ABCA3 gene creates novel 5' splice sites [20].\n",
      "The spliceosome is known to recognize cryptic splice sites instead of typical splice sites.\n",
      "Noncanonical splice sites are GC-AG, GG-AG, GT-TG, GT-CG, AT-AG, GA-AG, GT-AC, and CT-AG (5'-3' splice sites) [21-23].\n",
      "Mutations at the noncanonical splice site of the SEDL gene cause variants in X-linked spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda [24].\n",
      "Additionally, less exon skipping and more intron retention by alternative splice sites are observed in cancer tissue compared to normal tissues from an analysis of expression sequence tags (ESTs) [25].\n",
      "As a mutation of pre-mRNA, A to I RNA editing (conversion adenosine to inosine from deamination) also affects transcriptome diversification.\n",
      "RNA editing has regulatory roles, such as altering splice sites and sequences necessary for recognition of the spliceosome, resulting in modulation of alternatively spliced transcripts [26].\n",
      "The last case of alternative splicing is by cis-genomic mutations in regulatory factors, such as branch sites, exonic and intronic splicing enhancers, and silencers [7, 27].\n",
      "Pre-mRNA has exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs, ISEs) and silencers (ESSs, ISSs) that promote exon inclusion and exclusion by regulation of splice site recognition, respectively (Fig.1A).\n",
      "The arginine-serine-rich (SR) protein that binds to ESEs induces splicing via a helping assembly spliceosome by interacting with snRNP.\n",
      "On the contrary, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein is bound to ESEs and ISEs and inhibits splice site recognition by blocking spliceosome assembly [15, 27-29].\n",
      "Mutations in regulatory factor could disturb the binding of these spliceosome assembly-related proteins.\n",
      "Mutations at nucleotide positions 57 and 58 of the 174-bp-long exon 7 cause exon 7 skipping as a result of aberrant splicing by interrupted ESE-specific consensus sequences that are recognized by the SC35 and SF2/ASF SR proteins [10, 30].\n",
      "Additionally, Ron, encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein, has alternative splice transcripts.\n",
      "It is regulated by overexpression of SF2/ASF binding to ESE and ISE in colon and breast cancer [31].\n",
      "Alternative splicing is also known to be affected by epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin structure (Fig.1B).\n",
      "The relationship between chromatin structure and alternative splicing is still in a maze, but association studies are gradually increasing genomewide [32-34].\n",
      "Hisone modifications are enriched in exons rather than introns and related to exon expression, especially H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 [35, 36].\n",
      "H3K36me3 marking in exons is found in weakly expressed, alternatively spliced exons, indicating that histone modification has a relation to transcription via splicing-related marking mechanisms [36, 37].\n",
      "These histone marks could recruit splicing regulators with chromatin binding proteins and affect mRNA splicing [33].\n",
      "Additionally, hisone acethylation could modulate splicing rates to react quickly to changing conditions with increased RNA polymerase II processivity, and spliceosome rearrangements are affected by histone acetylation [38].\n",
      "Nevertheless, although there is little evidence, DNA methylation has been reported to have a relationship with splice sites.\n",
      "CpG dinucleotides are distributed nonrandomly in the genome.\n",
      "Exon skipping and mutually exclusive exons have significantly lower levels of both CG and mCG in the exonic regions, whereas intron retention has significantly higher levels of CG in both exonic and intronic regions [34].\n",
      "A DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), was inhibited by a methylation event of CD45 exon 5 [39].\n",
      "These epigenetic features are strongly associated with alternative splicing.\n",
      "Furthermore, these mechanisms are known to be changed according to cell type and disease states.\n",
      "Especially, in cancer, the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure effects aberrant gene expression by alternative splicing in cancer [1, 7, 8].\n",
      "Taken together, gene expression via alternative splicing is altered by complicated and mutual mechanisms, from genetic to epigenetic regulation.\n",
      "Therefore, it casts light on the understanding of cancer mechanisms by an investigation of alternative splicing patterns.\n",
      "A number of studies have been reported that alternative splicing is related closely to development, cellular stress, and various diseases, including cancer, as a crucial contributor to transcriptome and proteome diversity [1, 7, 8, 14].\n",
      "In cancer, with increasing genomic instability, sequence substitution and aberrant alternative splicing occur frequently, leading to erroneous and dysfunctional proteins [14].\n",
      "Protein isoforms made from this process are developmentally regulated and preferentially re-expressed in cancer and help the differentiation and survival of cancer cells (Fig.2).\n",
      "The development of genomewide analysis allows large-scale examination of the relationship between alternative splicing and tumorigenesis [40, 41].\n",
      "Every case of alternative splicing is reported in cancer; among these, the most frequent case is the mutually exclusive exon [14].\n",
      "For example, overexpression of CD44, involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and alternative splicing, by different splice sites of CD44 during tumorigenesis indicates that it could play roles in tumor cell invasion and metastasis [42-45].\n",
      "Tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog, deleted on chromosome TEN), have splicing variants associated to cancer [46].\n",
      "p53 protein isoforms through alternative splicing have critical roles in many biological processes, indicating that dysregulation effects tumorigenesis [47].\n",
      "Different expression of PTEN and its alternatively spliced transcripts are found to vary in different tissue types.\n",
      "PTEN regulates p53 stability and in turn regulates its own transcriptional activity.\n",
      "The PTEN splice variants retained in intron 3 region and intron 5 region have been found in breast cancer [46].\n",
      "In the case of the APC gene, aberrant splice skipping of exon 4, created by insertion of T in intron 4, is involved in colon cancer [48].\n",
      "An alternative 5' splice site in BCL-X results in 2 isoforms, long and short (Bcl-x (L), Bcl-x (X)), which have contrasting functions related to apoptosis and are overexpressed in various tumors [49, 50].\n",
      "Although specific roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms are not known exactly, among the isoforms of VEGF4 involved in formation of new vessels, VEGF165 and VEGF165b, created by an alternative 3' splice site, have different expression in cancer [51, 52].\n",
      "Over 40 different MDM2 transcripts are identified in normal and cancer by alternative 5' and 3' splice sites.\n",
      "They mostly lose the p53 binding domain and promote tumor progression and affect prognosis independently [53, 54].\n",
      "Increasing number of reports have demonstrated the expression of aberrant and abnormal splice variants in cancer cells or tissues.\n",

      "Structural genomic variants, mainly in the form of copy number variants (CNVs), have recently been rediscovered as contributors to evolution and as pathoetiologic elements for complex human diseases [5, 6].\n",

      "Title: F-statistics\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Wright [12] introduced F-statistics (FST, FIT, and FIS) as a tool for describing the partitioning of genetic diversity within and among populations that are directly related to the rates of evolutionary processes, such as migration, mutation, and drift.\n",
      "Specifically, F-statistics can be defined in many different ways: in terms of variances of allele frequencies, correlations between random gametes, and probabilities that two gametes chosen have different alleles.\n",
      "Depending on the relativity to the subpopulation or to the total population, FST, FIT, and FIS are defined, where subscript IS refers to 'individuals within subpopulations,' ST to 'subpopulations within the total population,' and IT to 'individuals within the total population.'\n",
      "Following the work of Cockerham [16], F-statistics are defined in terms of the variance components - that is, the total variation in the genetic data is broken down into three components: (a) between subpopulations within the total population (we sometimes say 'between populations'); (b) between individuals within subpopulations; and (c) between gametes within individuals.\n",
      "FST, FIT, and FIS are defined as the expectations under the model of a/(a + b + c), (a + b)/(a + b + c), and b/(b + c) and estimated by the corresponding sample values [17, 18].\n",
      "Here, it is perhaps pertinent to mention that when Weir and Cockerham [18] presented these definitions, they assumed a model consisting of an ancestral population from which subpopulations have descended in isolation under the same evolutionary processes.\n",
      "Thus, it is meaningful to have a single measure of population structure; that is, a global FST, which is an average over subpopulations.\n",
      "However, in identifying candidate loci under natural selection, evidence for locus-specific selection is of interest, and thus the estimators of locus-specific FST will be described in the next section.\n",
      "Often, readers may be confused with several terms appearing in population genetics.\n",
      "Wright [12] interprets FST as a measure of the progress of the subpopulation towards the fixation of one allele of each locus in the absence of mutation and hence called a 'fixation index.'\n",
      "FST is also interpreted as a measure of shared ancestry with the subpopulations, relative to that in the population, and is thus called the 'coancestry coefficient' [19].\n",
      "Therefore, if the value of FST is small, it means that the allele frequencies within each subpopulation are similar; if it is large, it means that the allele frequencies of subpopulations are different.\n",
      "On the other hand, FIS or FIT is defined as the correlation between two gametes that form a zygote relative to the subpopulation or population, and thus, FIS (or FIT) is called the 'inbreeding coefficient' [19].\n",
      "Title: Estimating FST by ANOVA methods\n",
      "\n",
      "The estimators of F-statistics proposed by Weir [17] and Weir and Cockerham [18] are based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of allele frequencies, equivalently called the method-of-moments estimates.\n",

      "The pattern of genetic differentiation at a neutral locus is completely determined by the demographic history, migration rates among the populations, and the mutation rates at the loci.\n",
      "It is reasonable to assume that all autosomal loci have experienced the same demographic history and migration rates among the populations, and the observed population structure can be largely explained by random drift at neutral loci.\n",
      "However, as the individuals from different populations often vary genetically at a few key sites in their genome, loci showing unusually large amounts of differentiation may indicate regions of the genome that have been subject to positive selection, whereas loci showing unusually small amounts of differentiation may indicate regions of the genome that have been subject to stabilizing (balancing) selection [15, 22-24].\n",

      "1), in which only the YRI population has non-neutral CNVs.\n",
      "In general, the observed population structure observed by hierarchical clustering, multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots, and tree plots can be largely explained by random drift at neutral CNVs.\n",
      "However, as individuals from different populations often vary genetically at a few key sites in their genome, only the outlier method makes it possible to detect accelerated divergence in some CNV regions of the genome due to local selection.\n",
      "This local selection is detected relative to the majority of CNVs, in which among-population differences are purely a result of genetic drift.\n",
      "Successful outlier detection depends on reliable and obtainable estimates of FST and also on sampling variances of FST.\n",
      "Very large variances that are associated with single locus moment estimates of FST preclude the use of these estimates to detect selection in spite of the fact that sampling variances will decrease with the number of alleles at a locus and with the numbers of populations sampled.\n",
      "In this respect, the availability of locus- and population-specific Bayesian estimates of FST provides a set of tools for identifying genomic regions or populations with unusual evolutionary histories.\n",
      "The most important benefits of Bayesian estimates and its selection method are that the Bayesian methods allow probability statements to be made about FST and can be extended to explore the relationship with demographic or environmental covariates in the model [26].\n",
      "Furthermore, likelihood-based Bayesian methods have the flexibility to accommodate missing data.\n",
      "However, implementations of Bayesian methods may be computationally demanding.\n",
      "Selection provides information about the adaptation to a wide range of habitats and climates [30], and thus, interpreting the story of human adaptation is an interesting research area for the studies of evolution and disease processes in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an essential role in the regulation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and triglyceride levels, which have been closely associated with cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "Genetic studies in European have shown that LPL single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are strongly associated with lipid levels.\n",
      "However, studies about the influence of interactions between LPL SNPs and lifestyle factors have not been sufficiently performed.\n",
      "Here, we examine if LPL polymorphisms, as well as their interaction with lifestyle factors, influence lipid concentrations in a Korean population.\n",
      "A two-stage association study was performed using genotype data for SNPs on the LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region from 7,536 (stage 1) and 3,703 (stage 2) individuals.\n",
      "The association study showed that 15 SNPs and 4 haplotypes were strongly associated with HDLC (lowest p = 2.86 × 10-22) and triglyceride levels (lowest p = 3.0 × 10-15).\n",
      "Interactions between LPL polymorphisms and lifestyle factors (lowest p = 9.6 × 10-4) were also observed on lipid concentrations.\n",
      "These findings suggest that there are interaction effects of LPL polymorphisms with lifestyle variables, including energy intake, fat intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as effects of LPL polymorphisms themselves, on lipid concentrations in a Korean population.\n",
      "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an important role in the metabolism and transport of lipids.\n",
      "It hydrolyzes triglycerides (TGs) in lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons (CMs) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), into free fatty acids, releasing CM remnants and intermediate-density lipoproteins that act on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) metabolism.\n",
      "Plasma LPL therefore plays an essential role in elevating HDLC and lowering TG [1-3].\n",
      "While HDLC plays a role in the removal and transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to other tissues where it is required, such as the liver, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) is, conversely, transported from the liver to peripheral tissues.\n",
      "The concentration of lipids has been tightly associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases [4-6].\n",
      "Specifically, LDLC levels have been shown to have a positive log-linear association with the risk of coronary heart disease: a reduction of 1% in the serum concentration of LDLC has been shown to reduce the relative risk of coronary heart disease risk by approximately 1% [7], whereas an increase of 1 mg/dL in serum HDLC levels is associated with a decrease in the risk of coronary heart disease of approximately 2% to 3%, independent of LDLC levels [8].\n",
      "It was also reported that TG levels are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of concentrations of other lipids and cardiac risk factors, although there has been controversy [6].\n",
      "Recently, a report based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys I, II, III, and IV has indicated that the prevalence of dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in this country has increased during the last decade [9].\n",
      "Genetic association studies aimed at identifying the genetic factors associated with variations in lipid concentrations have been performed mostly for Europeans, and they have shown that the polymorphisms in the LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region, are strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels [10-13].\n",
      "There is a report of a candidate gene approach for lipid concentrations in a Korean population, but the LPL gene was not included in the study [14].\n",
      "The concentration of lipids is also influenced by environmental factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity, as well as genetic factors [5, 15].\n",
      "However, studies about the influence of interactions between LPL polymorphisms and lifestyle factors have not been sufficiently performed.\n",

      "Carriers of each minor allele, but not non-carriers, led to a higher HDLC level through an interaction with a higher intake of fat (Fig.1).\n",
      "Each major genotype carrier of two SNPs (rs263 and rs271) showed lower HDLC levels and higher TG levels than minor allele carriers through an interaction with smoking (Fig.2).\n",
      "In the major genotype carrier of these two SNPs, higher TG levels were also found by interacting with alcohol consumption (Supplementary Fig.4), whereas each minor allele carrier was less affected than non-carriers by smoking or alcohol consumption.\n",
      "For interactions of HTs, blocks 1 and 2 were shown to interact with inconsistent lifestyle variables.\n",
      "Interaction effects of HT1 and 2 in block 1 with lifestyle factors, which were formed by the two SNPs, on lipid levels were almost same with those of rs263 and rs271 (data not shown).\n",
      "In the LPL gene, 61 missense mutations have been identified, and interestingly, 42 of them are located in exons 5 and 6, which may be contained in block 1 [46].\n",
      "Carrier of HT3 in block 2, which was reported to be associated with increased LPL activity [25], showed higher HDLC levels and lower TG levels, whereas non-carriers were not affected by a higher energy intake (Fig.3, Supplementary Fig.3).\n",
      "In the non-carrier of HT4 in block 2, higher TG levels were found by interacting with cigarette smoking (Supplementary Fig.4).\n",
      "Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption were reported to be related with reduced and increased LPL activity, respectively [47, 48], but the precise mechanisms by which the interaction of LPL polymorphisms with environmental factors affects lipid concentrations have not been demonstrated yet.\n",
      "In conclusion, we found that HTs are strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels in the 2 blocks in which LPL SNPs are included and that SNPs in these blocks are also strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels in stage 1.\n",
      "Interestingly, these results were replicated in stage 2, which consists of independent samples, and the combined analyses, including the samples of stages 1 and 2, showed the most significant results.\n",
      "Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the interaction of LPL polymorphisms with several lifestyle factors on plasma lipid levels, we have shown that the effects of some LPL SNPs and HTs on HDLC and TG concentrations are regulated by energy and fat intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption.\n",
      "Since these results have not been reported in any previous studies, they are novel findings.\n",
      "These interaction effects suggest that the appropriate lifestyle of each individual could be recommended according to the type of LPL polymorphism.\n",

      "These lipid-related traits, including ~14-54% for TG, ~34-42% for HDL-C, and ~28-50% for LDL-C, are highly heritable in familial T2D or diabetic patients [19, 20].\n",
      "These estimates indicate that genetic variants play important roles in explaining inter-individual variations in blood lipid levels.\n",
      "Although systematic reviews have reported relationships between childhood obesity and adult CVD risk [21, 22], there is not a shred of evidence that blood lipid status in adults is an independent or dependent risk factor in a childhood obesity group.\n",

      "In Asia, genetic admixing has been also prevalent among previously separated human populations.\n",

      "Here, I will provide an overview of population genomic studies that have been published to date on human admixture in Asia, focusing on population structure and population history.\n",
      "Before I review the recent research progress on Asian admixed populations, I would like to first give some overview of the background of admixture studies, especially in the context of population genomics, since admixture analysis is only feasible when individual genomic data are available.\n",
      "Human migration resulted in population differentiation, and many populations, especially those living in different continents, have been isolated for quite a long time.\n",
      "However, subsequent migrations that have occurred over the past millennia have resulted in gene flow between previously separated human subpopulations.\n",
      "This has been a common phenomenon throughout the history of modern humans, as previously isolated populations often come into contact through colonization and migration.\n",
      "As a result, admixed populations came into being when previously mutually isolated populations met and inter-married.\n",
      "It is important to conduct a full analysis of genetic structure and characterize the genetic make-up of admixed populations.\n",
      "On the one hand, this will shed light on human genetic history; on the other hand, increased population admixture influences genome heterozygosity, which in turn will affect phenotypes relevant to health; thus, genetic admixture has many implications in medical research.\n",
      "The estimation of genetic admixture in human populations has been used for a variety of purposes, ranging from the confirmation of historical events, such as population of the effects of other biological parameters, but the emphasis in early studies was on gene mapping of continuous traits.\n",
      "Admixture mapping is a method for localizing disease-causing genetic variants that differ in frequency across populations.\n",
      "This approach was proposed by McKeigue in 1998 [1]; it is based on the association of local chromosomal ancestry with the disease, to test for the linkage of the disease or trait with parental ancestry at each locus, defined as 0, 1, or 2 allele copies inherited from the ancestral populations.\n",
      "However, the idea of using genetic architecture in admixed genomes to locate disease-associated genes was actually first proposed by Rife in 1954 [2], although the original idea was to use the admixture linkage disequilibrium (ALD) generated in recently admixed human populations to assign the traits to linkage groups.\n",
      "Admixture of populations often leads to extended linkage disequilibrium (LD), which could greatly facilitate the mapping of human disease genes [3-6].\n",
      "Gene mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) has been shown to have special value theoretically [4, 7-14] and empirically [15-29].\n",
      "MALD has received much attention recently [3, 5].\n",
      "The initial attraction of MALD was its significantly increased extension of LD (or extended LD) in admixed populations, which requires far fewer markers in mapping disease genes.\n",
      "Previous studies predicted that MALD typically requires only 2,000-3,000 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) for a genomewide search [1, 16].\n",
      "The utility of MALD depends upon how far LD extends over a chromosomal interval, which, in turn, dictates the spacing and number of markers required for a genomewide scan.\n",
      "Therefore, it is imperative to characterize the magnitude and extent of ALD in the admixed population in which MALD will be performed.\n",
      "Stephens et al.\n",
      "[10] showed that ALD in African-Americans (AfAs) could exist up to 10 cM, even after 9 generations by simulation.\n",
      "Parra et al.\n",
      "[30] reported strong LD between the FY-null and AT3 loci, which are 22 cM apart on chromosome 1q22.\n",
      "Substantially extended LD in AfA populations were reported in several regions or chromosomes [31-33] using primarily short tandem repeat markers.\n",
      "Patterson et al.\n",
      "[12] showed that strong ALD extends to 17 cM on average in AfAs.\n",
      "Contrarily, it was also reported that the LD in AfA populations is shorter than or similar to those seen in non-admixed populations using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-detectable to about 44 kb or larger [34].\n",
      "The contradicting observations might be due to the selection of the markers based on their allele frequency difference between the parental populations, as shown theoretically by Chakraborty and Weiss [7].\n",
      "It is therefore important to examine empirically the relationship of LD in the admixed population and allele frequency difference between parental populations.\n",
      "In fact, there have been many studies that have investigated LD patterns in recent admixed populations, such as the AfAs, Mexicans, and Hispanics.\n",
      "In Asia, the only study published so far is on the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China [35].\n",
      "In practice, the principle of admixture mapping, proposed by McKeigue [1], is a little different from that of MALD, because it is based on the association of local chromosomal ancestry with the disease rather than on LD between the marker and phenotype, but the information and essence are the same.\n",
      "It is most advantageous to apply this approach to populations that have descended from a recent mix of two ancestral groups that have been geographically isolated for many tens of thousands of years, providing new insights into population history and genotype-phenotype relationships.\n",
      "With the efforts of many scientists in this field, statistical methods, panels of AIMs for admixture typing, and software programs have been rapidly developed; in addition, recent advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies have facilitated genomewide investigation of human genetic variations.\n",
      "Admixture mapping has been applied to a wide range of traits and diseases, for which it is hypothesized that the differences in disease rates across populations are due to population-specific frequency differences of the causal variant(s).\n",
      "To apply admixture mapping, a set of genetic markers called AIMs, provide information at each locus of the ancestral origin of the allele.\n",
      "An AIM is a polymorphic locus that exhibits substantially different allele frequencies between the ancestral populations, which are often from different geographical regions.\n",
      "For example, Fig.1 shows an allele frequency distribution of 9,781 AIMs screened from genomewide SNPs from European (EUR) and East Asian (EAS) populations.\n",
      "With a set of AIMs, one can estimate the geographical origins of the ancestors of an individual and ascertain what proportion of the ancestry is derived from each geographical region.\n",
      "The primary utility of estimates of continental ancestry using AIMs is to control for confounding from population stratification in genetic association studies among unrelated individuals from admixed populations.\n",
      "Population admixture has the potential to lead to confounding results from population stratification in genetic association studies, leading to both false positive (type I error) and false negative (type II error) results [36-39].\n",
      "Now, to facilitate the application of admixture mapping, a number of high-density mapping panels have been constructed, Such panels are already available for disease gene discovery in AfAs [16, 21, 40, 41], Hispanics/Latinos [23, 26, 40], Mexican-Americans (the largest subgroup of Hispanic/Latinos) [28, 41], and Uyghurs [35].\n",
      "Identifying targets of positive selection in humans has been a central topic in human evolutionary and population genetics.\n",
      "Traditional studies have been relying on the analysis of individual candidate genes.\n",
      "Since the genomics era, the availability of high-density SNPs has provided essential resources for systematically interrogating the entire genome for detecting signatures of natural selection.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, many genomewide scans for recent or ongoing positive selection have been recently performed in humans, while most of the studies to date have been performed in non-admixed populations.\n",
      "In the situation of genetic admixture, when previously isolated populations meet and mix, the resulting admixed population can benefit from several genetic advantages, including increased genetic variation, the creation of novel genotypes, and the masking of deleterious mutations, and these admixture benefits are thought to play an important role in biological adaptation to local environment.\n",
      "As a result, this has led to the use of admixture estimates to detect the action of natural selection in human populations.\n",
      "Such techniques have been regarded as powerful methods for the detection of selection effects, especially when an appreciable number of generations have elapsed since the original admixture.\n",
      "Several studies based on genomic data have been conducted in recently admixed populations in the New World [42-44].\n",
      "Recently, we developed a new approach that can be used to detect natural selection both before and after population admixture, and we applied this method in AfA data.\n",
      "It is particularly meaningful to investigate natural selection in AfAs due to the high mortality their African ancestry has experienced in history.\n",
      "In this study, we examined 491,526 autosomal SNPs genotyped in 5,210 individuals and conducted a genomewide search for selection signals in 1,890 AfAs.\n",
      "Several genomic regions showing excess African or EUR ancestry, which were thought of as the footprints of selection since population admixture, were detected based on a commonly used approach.\n",
      "However, we also developed a new strategy to detect natural selection both pre- and post-admixture by reconstructing an ancestral African population (AAF) from inferred African components of ancestry in AfAs and comparing it with indigenous African populations (IAF).\n",
      "Interestingly, many selection candidate genes identified by the new approach were associated with AfA-specific high-risk diseases, such as prostate cancer and hypertension, suggesting an important role that these disease-related genes might have played in adapting to a new environment.\n",
      "CD36 and HBB, whose mutations confer a degree of protection against malaria, were also located in the highly differentiated regions between AAF and IAF.\n",
      "Further analysis showed that the frequencies of alleles protecting against malaria in AAF were lower than that in IAF, which is consistent with the relaxed selection pressure of malaria in the New World.\n",
      "There is no overlap between the top candidate genes detected by the 2 approaches, indicating the different environmental pressures AfAs experienced pre- and post-population admixture.\n",
      "We suggest that the new approach (see Fig.2 for a schematic framework of this approach) is reasonably powerful and can also be applied to other admixed populations, such as Latinos and Uyghurs.\n",
      "I will not go further on this topic in this review paper, since so far there is no study that has been performed in Asian populations using admixture analysis.\n",
      "However, we believe that the discoveries have greatly enriched our understanding of human origins and history and hold large potential for identifying genes with important biological functions; this, in turn, will elucidate the genetic basis of some human diseases [45, 46].\n",
      "These studies together provide many new insights into the natural selection process and mechanisms, which will ultimately improve the modern evolution theory.\n",
      "Human diasporas over the past millennia have resulted in even more frequent intercontinental marriages and population admixtures.\n",
      "Many recently admixed populations, such as AfAs and Mestizos, have received much attention due to their potential advantages in the discovery of disease-associated genes.\n",
      "Particularly, a disease gene mapping strategy, named admixture mapping or MALD, as aforementioned, has been developed [1, 7, 11, 47].\n",
      "The statistical power of admixture mapping or MALD relies on the fact that population admixture creates extended and elevated LD between loci with different allele frequencies among the parental source populations [7, 10, 48], while the historical population admixture processes determine the LD pattern in an admixed population.\n",
      "Therefore, as shown in several theoretical and simulation studies, population admixture dynamics have a strong effect on the power of admixture mapping [48-51].\n",
      "In fact, accurate understanding of population admixture dynamics is important not only to admixture mapping but also to other applications, such as elucidating population history [52] and detecting natural selection signatures in admixed populations [49, 53].\n",
      "However, the fine admixture dynamics of recently admixed populations has not been well established, even though some studies have examined the simulated data [54, 55] or experimental data with sparse markers [48, 51].\n",
      "In addition, admixture dynamics of relatively ancient admixed populations has rarely been studied.\n",
      "Recently, the availability of genomewide high-density SNPs data has facilitated the study on detailed genetic structures of admixed populations [35, 44, 56-61].\n",
      "However, most of these studies relied on simplified models that do not take into account the inherent complexity of the admixture processes.\n",
      "Moreover, the haplotype and chromosomal segment patterns shaped by recombination within each individual have been deliberately ignored in most studies due to many inherent challenges [62].\n",
      "For individuals from admixed populations that have existed for a long time, their chromosomes resemble a mosaic of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry (CSDA).\n",
      "The CSDA in the admixed population would have been reshaped and rearranged by recombination in each generation, which should provide some information about the population history.\n",
      "In other words, the CSDA will be spliced into smaller pieces as the number of generations since admixture increases, while the chromosomes from recently admixed individuals contain much longer CSDAs.\n",
      "Information regarding the average CSDA length has been used to infer the number of generations since admixture in various studies [57, 63-66].\n",
      "However, the distribution of CSDA length may contain more valuable information concerning population admixture history and admixture dynamics, which has not yet been explored.\n",
      "In a recent study [67], we proposed 2 approaches to explore population admixture dynamics and, by analyzing genomewide empirical and simulated data, demonstrated that the approach based on the distribution of CSDA was more powerful than that based on the distribution of individual ancestry proportions.\n",
      "As a result, analysis of 1,890 AfAs showed that a continuous gene flow (CGF) model (Fig.3), in which AfAs continuously received gene flow from EUR populations over about 14 generations, best explained the admixture dynamics of AfAs among several putative models.\n",
      "Interestingly, we observed that some AfAs had much more EUR ancestry than the simulated samples, indicating substructures of local ancestries in AfAs that could have been caused by individuals from some particular lineages having continuously inter-married with people of EUR ancestry.\n",
      "On the contrary, the admixture dynamics of Mexicans was more likely to be explained by a gradual admixture (GA) model (Fig.3), in which Mexicans continuously received gene flow from both EUR and Amerindian populations for about 24 generations.\n",
      "The higher proportion of long CSDAs observed in Mexican-Americans relative to Mexican-Mestizos suggested recent gene flow from EUR-Americans to Mexican-Americans.\n",
      "The genetic components of sub-Saharan Africans in Middle Eastern populations, such as Mozabite, Bedouin, and Palestinians, could be explained by one early admixture followed by some recent gene flow from Africans.\n",
      "In summary, this study not only provides new approaches to explore population admixture dynamics but also advances our understanding on historical admixture processes of AfAs, Mexicans, and Middle Eastern populations.\n",
      "Again, since admixed populations in Asia have not been studied, I will not go further into details.\n",
      "This approach can be also applied in admixed populations in Asia to explore the admixture dynamics of admixed populations in Asia.\n",
      "In East Asia, most of the populations that have been studied are thought to be relatively homogeneous.\n",
      "Most people identify themselves with one particular ethnic group, but in fact, we are highly mixed.\n",
      "A report from the HUGO PanAsia SNP Consortium, which was published in Science in 2009 [68], revealed a picture of prevalent gene flow among Asian populations.\n",
      "As a collaborative effort of 93 scientists from 10 countries, this study conducted the first large-scale and genomewide study on the genetic diversity of 73 Asian populations, representing a broad geographic sample of the major ethnic groups and linguistic families in Asia.\n",
      "Considerable gene flow among Asian populations was observed amongst sub-populations in these clusters, including those groups believed to practice endogamy based on linguistic, cultural, and ethnic information.\n",
      "In fact, most populations studied show evidence of admixture in population structure analyses.\n",
      "For example, the Han Chinese have grown to become the largest ethnic group today, in a demographic expansion that has occurred mostly within historical times.\n",
      "The analysis in this study reveals that the 6 Han Chinese populations show varying degrees of admixture (Fig.4) between a northern 'Altaic' cluster and a 'Sino-Tibetan/Tai-Kadai' cluster, which is most frequent in the ethnic groups sampled from southern China and northern Thailand.\n",
      "Finally, most of the Indian populations showed evidence of shared ancestry with EUR populations, which is consistent with our understanding of the expansion of Indo-EUR speaking populations (Fig.4).\n",
      "Many human populations that settled in Central Asia demonstrate an array of mixed anthropological features of East Eurasians (EEA) and West Eurasians (WEA), indicating a possible scenario of biological admixture between already differentiated EEA and WEA populations.\n",
      "However, their complex biological origin and genomic make-up, as well as their genetic interaction with surrounding populations, are not well understood.\n",
      "Despite Central Asia being a vast territory that has been crucial in human history due to its strategic location [69], populations in this region are not on the list of the 2 large-scale international collaborative efforts, such as the International HapMap Project [70] and the 1000 Genome Project [71], and population genomic studies on Central Asian populations have been largely underrepresented in similar efforts worldwide [68, 72-76].\n",
      "In an attempt to decipher the genetic structure and population history in Central Asia, we conducted, to our knowledge, the first genomewide studies of the Uyghur residing in Xinjiang, which is geographically located in Central Asia.\n",
      "Uyghur that settled in Xinjiang of China (UIG) is a population presenting a typical admixture of eastern and western anthropometric traits; we dissected its genomic structure at the population level, individual level, and chromosome level using 20,177 SNPs spanning over almost the entire chromosome 21.\n",
      "Our results showed that UIG was formed by two-way admixture, with 60% of ancestry from EUR and 40% of ancestry from EAS.\n",
      "Overall LD in UIG was similar to that in its parental populations, represented by EAS and EUR for common alleles, and UIG manifested elevation of LD only within 500 kb and at a level of 0.1 < r2 < 0.8 when AIMs were used.\n",
      "The size of chromosomal segments that were derived from EASs and EURs was on average 2.4 cM and 4.1 cM, respectively.\n",
      "Both the magnitude of LD and fragmentary ancestral chromosome segments indicated a long period of history of Uyghur.\n",
      "Under the assumption of a hybrid isolation (HI) model, the admixture event of UIG was estimated to have taken place about 126 (107-146) generations, or 2,520 (2,140-2,920) years ago, assuming 20 years per generation.\n",
      "In spite of the long history and short LD of Uyghur compared with recent admixture populations, such as African-Americans, we suggested that MALD is still applicable in Uyghur, except that about 10-fold AIMs are necessary for a whole-genome scan.\n",
      "Later in the same year, following up on our previous study, we conducted a genomewide analysis of admixture for 2 Uyghur population samples (HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG) collected from northern and southern Xinjiang of China, respectively.\n",
      "Both HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG showed substantial admixture of EAS and EUR ancestries, with an empirical estimation of ancestry contribution of 53:47 (EAS:EUR) and 48:52 for HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG, respectively.\n",
      "The effective admixture time under a model with a single pulse of admixture was estimated to be 110 generations and 129 generations; i.e., admixture events occurred about 2,200 years and 2,580 years ago for HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG, respectively, assuming an average of 20 years per generation.\n",
      "Despite their earlier history versus other admixture populations, such as AfAs and Latinos, admixture mapping, an economical and powerful approach for localizing disease genes, holds equal promise for Uyghurs because of their mixture of ancestry from different continents as well as their large population size.\n",
      "We screened multiple databases and identified a genomewide SNP panel that can distinguish EAS and EUR ancestry of chromosomal segments in Uyghurs.\n",
      "The panel contains 8,150 AIMs showing large frequency differences between EAS and EUR (FST > 0.25, mean FST = 0.43) but little frequency difference (7,999 AIMs validated) within both EAS and EUR populations (FST < 0.05, mean FST < 0.01).\n",
      "We evaluated the effectiveness of this admixture map for localizing disease genes in 2 Uyghur populations.\n",
      "Our map constitutes the first practical resource for admixture mapping in Uyghurs, and it will enable studies of diseases showing different genetic risks in European and EAS populations.\n",
      "Southeast Asia, together with the Island Pacific region, is a cultural melting pot of migrating Neolithic farmers and indigenous Mesolithic hunter-gatherer communities.\n",
      "On the basis of increased cultural, linguistic, and genetic diversity, the origins of Southeast Asian populations are thought to be more complex than those to their north.\n",
      "Two major prehistoric movements of people had great influence on the linguistic, cultural, and genetic diversity of the region.\n",
      "The first colonization of modern humans in the region was around 45,000 years before the present [77], which could have brought the ancestors of modern Papuans and Australians into the region [78].\n",
      "Notably, archaeological evidence has confirmed human habitation in Eastern Indonesia as far back as 32,000 years ago [79].\n",
      "The second major human migration event, which is often termed the Austronesian expansion, was relatively recent, coinciding with the first agricultural settlements in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) [80]; it is often putatively linked to demic dispersal from mainland China during the Mid-Holocene [81], and based on linguistic studies, the Austronesian expansion is proposed to have originated in Taiwan around 5,000-6,000 years ago and spread to Southeast Asia, Near and Remote Oceania, and Madagascar [82, 83].\n",
      "However, our knowledge about the historical origin and spread of Austronesian-speaking peoples has been overwhelmingly from linguistic, archeological, and anthropological studies, while contributions from genetic studies are limited, and especially, genetic dating of the expansion time of Austronesians is almost absent [84].\n",
      "Undoubtedly, the Austronesian expansion has had a major cultural influence on Asia-Pacific pre-history.\n",
      "The biological contribution of Austronesian-speaking peoples to the pre-existing local populations in ISEA was first noted by Wallace in 1869 [85].\n",
      "As Wallace observed, people in the region between mainland Asia and New Guinea in the west are similar to their neighbors in mainland Southeast Asia, while the eastern groups near New Guinea are similar to Melanesians, leaving intervening populations intermediate in appearance [85].\n",
      "This admixture pattern was revealed by mtDNA and non-recombining region of the Y chromosome (NRY) studies [86, 87] as well as by a recent study [81] based on multiple autosomal and X-chromosomal SNPs.\n",
      "The genetic admixture with local populations during the Austronesian expansion could provide a unique opportunity to shed light on the migration history of Austronesian-speaking people.\n",
      "However, previous studies based on haploid genomes could not study admixture at the individual level.\n",
      "Studies of multiple loci of the nuclear genome are more powerful [88] in studying admixture at the individual level, but the sparse low-density loci examined in previous genomewide studies do not allow estimation of the admixture time, which relies on recombination information extracted from high-density genomewide data.\n",
      "We analyzed dense genomewide SNP data from 2 studies [68, 89].\n",
      "The first consists of about 50,000 SNPs analyzed in 288 individuals from 13 Austronesian-speaking populations and 2 Papuan-speaking populations across Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, while the second consists of about 680,000 SNPs analyzed in 36 individuals from 7 populations from Indonesia and 25 individuals from New Guinea.\n",
      "Apart from a general description of population structure and its relationship with geography, language, and demographic history, we focus on estimating the amount and time of admixture involving Asian and Papuan ancestry across E. Indonesia to test the various scenarios that might explain the admixture history.\n",
      "Because genetic recombination breaks down parental genomes into segments of different sizes, the genome of a descendant of an admixture event is composed of different combinations of these ancestral segments, or 'blocks' [90].\n",
      "Admixture time can be estimated from the information based on distribution of ancestral segments and the recombination breakpoints in an admixed genome [34, 57, 63, 66, 90].\n",
      "In this study, we assume that a cline of admixture times that decreases from west to east across E. Indonesia would support a scenario of incoming Asians admixing with indigenous Papuan groups, while a cline in the opposite direction would indicate incoming Papuans admixing with resident Asians.\n",
      "Moreover, the actual admixture times would indicate when the migration occurred.\n",
      "Our approach is thus to estimate population admixture time by taking advantage of available genomewide data of both E. Indonesian populations showing admixture and their ancestry reference populations.\n",
      "In summary, the admixture time analysis of 2 different datasets provides compelling evidence that people of Asian ancestry began moving through E. Indonesia about 4,000 years ago, from west to east, and admixed with resident groups of Papuan ancestry.\n",
      "Furthermore, this scenario is in excellent agreement with linguistic and archeological evidence for a pre-Austronesian presence of Papuans in E. Indonesia [91, 92] and for an eastward spread of Austronesian-speaking farmers across E. Indonesia [82, 83].\n",
      "Our analyses thus refute suggestions that the Asian ancestry observed in Indonesia largely predates the Austronesian expansion [93, 94].\n",
      "Instead, our analyses of genomewide data indicate that there was a strong and significant genetic impact associated with the Austronesian expansion in Indonesia, just as similar analyses have pointed to a strong and significant genetic impact associated with the Austronesian expansion through Near and Remote Oceania [87, 95, 96].\n",
      "Given that admixture among human populations (and between modern and archaic humans) is increasingly being recognized as a significant aspect of modern human biology [97], estimates of the time of admixture should provide important new insights into the history of our species.\n",
      "All the published results in this area so far have been focused on populations in India.\n",
      "There were recently 2 studies on the Siddis, which are a group of people showing evident genetic admixture in India.\n",
      "The Siddis (Afro-Indians) are a tribal population whose members live in coastal Karnataka, Gujarat, and some parts of Andhra Pradesh.\n",
      "Historical records indicate that the Portuguese brought the Siddis to India from Africa about 300-500 years ago; members of this population are believed to be descendants of the Bantu-speaking population of Africa.\n",
      "However, there is little information about their more precise ancestral origins.\n",
      "One Indian group, led by Dr. Mukerji, studied this population [98] based on genomewide SNP data generated using Affymetrix 50K chips.\n",
      "The authors carried out this study by using a set of 18,534 autosomal markers common between Indian, CEPH-HGDP, and HapMap populations.\n",
      "Principal components analysis clearly revealed that the African-Indian population derived its ancestry from Bantu-speaking west African as well as Indo-European-speaking north and northwest Indian population(s).\n",
      "STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analyses show that overall, the OG-W-IPs derived 58.7% of their genomic ancestry from their African past and have very little inter-individual ancestry variation (8.4%).\n",
      "The extent of LD also reveals that the admixture event has been recent.\n",
      "Functional annotation of genes encompassing the AIMs that are closer in allele frequency to the Indian ancestral population revealed significant enrichment of biological processes, such as ion channel activity, and cadherins.\n",
      "They briefly examined the implications of determining the genetic diversity of this population, which could provide opportunities for studies involving admixture mapping.\n",
      "The second group, led by Dr. Thangaraj, performed a genomewide survey to understand the population history of the Siddis [99].\n",
      "Using hundreds of thousands of autosomal markers, they showed that the Siddis inherited ancestry from Africans, Indians, and possibly Europeans (Portuguese).\n",
      "Additionally, analyses of the uniparental (Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA) markers indicate that the Siddis trace their ancestry to Bantu speakers from sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "They estimated that the admixture between the African ancestors of the Siddis and neighboring South Asian groups probably occurred in the past 8 generations (-200 years ago), consistent with historical records.\n",
      "Recent advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies have facilitated genomewide investigation of human genetic variations and provided new insights into population structure and admixture history.\n",
      "Admixed populations are attracting more and more attention from both evolutionary and medical studies as well as from the other fields.\n",
      "Without understanding the genetic structure and history of admixed populations well, our knowledge about human genetics would not be complete.\n",
      "Unfortunately, studies on admixed populations in Asia are so far very limited, although gene flow among Asian populations is prevalent [68].\n",
      "The studies published and mentioned in this review have been focused on investigating the genetic structure and genetic history of a limited number of well-known admixed populations in Asia.\n",
      "Further efforts should be made to reveal local adaptation signatures and also apply admixture mapping in those well-known admixed populations; in the future, more powerful methods are expected to be developed and applied to many more populations with longer histories and more complex admixture scenarios.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chromatin structure and dynamics that are influenced by epigenetic marks, such as histone modification and DNA methylation, play a crucial role in modulating gene transcription.\n",
      "To understand the relationship between histone modifications and regulatory elements in breast cancer cells, we compared our chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) histone modification patterns for histone H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/16ac, and H3K27me3 in MCF-7 cells with publicly available formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)-chip signals in human chromosomes 8, 11, and 12, identified by a method called FAIRE.\n",
      "Active regulatory elements defined by FAIRE were highly associated with active histone modifications, like H3K4me3 and H3K9/16ac, especially near transcription start sites.\n",
      "The H3K9/16ac-enriched genes that overlapped with FAIRE signals (FAIRE-H3K9/14ac) were moderately correlated with gene expression levels.\n",
      "We also identified functional sequence motifs at H3K4me1-enriched FAIRE sites upstream of putative promoters, suggesting that regulatory elements could be associated with H3K4me1 to be regarded as distal regulatory elements.\n",
      "Our results might provide an insight into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms explaining the association of histone modifications with open chromatin structure in breast cancer cells.\n",
      "The epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histones without altering DNA sequences is tightly linked to the gene expression program in eukaryotic genomes.\n",
      "The N-terminal tails of histones are subject to various types of modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, and sumoylation [1].\n",
      "Dynamic changes by histone-modifying enzymes affect the chromatin accessibility to transcriptional machinery and thus modulate gene activation or silencing in diverse biological processes, such as transcription, DNA repair, development and differentiation, and genome stability [2-4].\n",
      "Moreover, nucleosome positioning can also be controlled by specific histone modifications, leading to alteration of cross-talk among chromatin structure, exon-intron architecture, and RNA polymerase II binding [5, 6].\n",
      "Genomewide profiles of histone modifications with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) have revealed the characteristic genomic distribution and the association of gene functions and activities in eukaryotic genomes [7-12].\n",
      "ChIP-Seq is a popularly used method to find genomewide protein binding sites with a high resolution by chromatin-immunoprecipitation by massive DNA sequencing using high-throughput sequencing technology [11].\n",
      "For example, trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which is catalyzed by trithorax complex, as well as histone acetylation (e.g., H3K9/16ac) are usually enriched at promoter regions or transcription start sites (TSSs) with open chromatin structure and positively correlated with gene transcriptional activation level.\n",
      "H3K4me1 is also found to be enriched at enhancer-associated regions.\n",
      "These modifications recruit the transcriptional machinery at target sites.\n",
      "Trimethylation of H3K27, catalyzed by polycomb group protein complex 2 (PRC2), contributes to gene silencing by promoting chromatin condensation and chromatin stabilization and is likely to spread over larger regions around TSSs of silent genes.\n",
      "The signals of H3K9me3 are high in silent genes or repressed chromatin domains, such as heterochromatin.\n",
      "The comprehensive and comparative analysis of many histone modifications in the human genome demonstrates that the combination of several histone modifications shows a modular pattern and regulates transcriptional activation in a cooperative manner [13].\n",
      "Interestingly, many loci of H3K27me3 are often colocalized with those of H3K4me3 around TSSs of lowly expressed genes in stem-like cells, many of which are positioned at developmental regulators, including transcription factors and signaling proteins [14].\n",
      "This suggests that the formation of a bivalent chromatin domain can be a signature of epigenetic memory and that programmed gene expression during differentiation is dependent on chromatin modifications [14].\n",
      "The interactions of variations in the genome, epigenome, and transcriptome with sensing of environmental stimuli can determine phenotypic plasticity.\n",
      "Traditionally, phenotypic variation has been explained primarily through genetic variation with sequence changes during evolution.\n",
      "However, epigenetic variations that are potentially sensitive to environmental inputs can alter transcriptional activity, which in turn contributes to diversity of complex traits [15].\n",

      "In addition, to determine the network communications among the TLR, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), and GPCR, we tested RAW 264.7 cells with KDO, interferon-β, or cAMP analog 8-Br.\n",

      "For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes severe inflammatory responses by binding to and signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cell surface, and events downstream of TLR stimulation are extremely dynamic [1, 2].\n",
      "The inner core regions of all LPS molecules contain at least one 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDO) residue, which possesses endotoxin toxicity that is nearly equivalent to LPS itself [3, 4].\n",

      "IFN-β uses the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and 8-Br is a cell-permeable analog of cAMP that is regulated by Gαs- or Gαi-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).\n",
      "In response to LPS, TLR4 activates the MyD88-independent pathway to produce tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [5], whereas 8-Br activates cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which binds to cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sequences, 5'-TGACGTCA-3', and is also a substrate for various cellular kinases [6-10].\n",

      "Since protein kinase A (PKA) activation by cAMP suppresses the MAPK cascade through phosphorylation of Raf [28], we can not exclude the possibility that elevated cAMP may, in part, reduce the transcription of the targeted genes by modulating protein binding to AP-1 sites, by inhibiting the ERK pathway through Raf, and/or by specifically affecting NF-κB subunits.\n",

      "Several IFN-β and KDO primary responsive genes were upregulated, including genes that activate the immune system.\n",
      "In some cases, the IFN-β gene signature dominated over the KDO gene signature.\n",
      "For example, IFN-β inhibited two KDO primary responsive genes, Il-1ra and Nfκbζ, but KDO did not change the expression of any of the interferon-responsive primary genes.\n",
      "The expression levels of select genes were validated by using QRT-PCR (Fig.4).\n",
      "Cytokine assays, conducted following a combination of LPS and IFN-β treatment, also demonstrated non-additive enhancement of Il-6, Il-10, RANTES, and TNF protein levels (Fig.5A).\n",
      "This increase could be due to synergistic production of transcription factors in response to these ligands, apart from their classical transcription factors.\n",
      "It is likely that the rapid, greater-than-2-fold increase in Socs1 and Cish production may have contributed to the attenuated expression of the KDO secondary responsive genes [29, 30].\n",
      "Il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine regulated through the PI3K-AKT-GSK-CREB pathway [31, 32], and we noted its expression after 120 min of stimulation, suggesting that the PI3K pathway may have been activated after 60 min of stimulation.\n",

      "Upregulation of GAS-driven genes requires the Stat1 homodimer exclusively but not NF-κB; they are both produced by IFN-γ.\n",
      "Interestingly, in our study, we did not observe elevated expression of IFN-γ or STAT1 mRNA, but we still observed the production of GAS-driven genes.\n",
      "Two phosphorylation sites, Tyr-701 and Ser-727, differentially regulate Stat1, and phosphorylation of both sites is required for maximal transcriptional activity [35, 36].\n",
      "A previous study demonstrated that Stat1 is phosphorylated on both Tyr-701 and Ser-727 in LPS-treated cells after 2 h [37].\n",
      "We surmise that this enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 may be mediated by KDO and IFN-β.\n",
      "However, when we conducted STAT1 phosphoprotein measurements with KDO and IFN-β in combination, we observed a 3-fold upregulation in phosphorylated STAT1 after 30 min (Fig.5B).\n",

      "CREB can be induced to a certain extent through the ERK pathway by KDO; however, such a claim remains to be proven in the future studies.\n",
      "This approach further raises a question on by which mechanism, if not CREB and NF-κB, KDO attenuates 8-Br induced changes, which also remains to be tested.\n",
      "One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that KDO stimulation rapidly downregulated the 8-Br-induced increase in intracellular cAMP through the action of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that transform cAMP into inactive AMP [38].\n",
      "In support of this idea, LPS stimulation of mouse peripheral leukocytes induced Pde4b mRNA accumulation and increased PDE4 activity [39].\n",
      "This increase in PDE4 activity leads to a decrease in cAMP, thus removing the cAMP constraint and allowing for full induction of Tnf mRNA.\n",
      "PKA phosphorylation inhibits Raf1 directly [40, 41], and this inhibition occurs downstream of Ras [42, 43] to inhibit Ras-dependent signaling to ERK [44].\n",

      "We have restricted our studies to 2 h; hence, we can not emphasize on the secondary sequences of NF-κB, but we observed that most of the induced genes have putative or known AP-1 or IRF-3 sites.\n",
      "The gene expression in dual treatment of IFN-β and KDO was specifically mediated by STAT proteins and NF-κB.\n",
      "Also, gene transcription during macrophage activation through TLR4 and the elevation of IFN-β simultaneously resulted in alterations in the chromatin structure of gene promoters that further influenced transcription initiation events.\n",
      "Combining IFN-β and KDO induced the IFN-β secondary responsive genes Gbp1, Gbp2, and Gbp5 by more than 4-fold, but it attenuated several KDO secondary responsive genes, including Socs5, Cish, Fosl, Rgs16, Cxcr9, Ifit3, and Ctf1.\n",
      "In contrast, dual KDO and IFN-β treatment enhanced the expression of several transcription factors after 60 and 120 min of stimulation, most notably Atf3.\n",

      "It is interesting to note that that there should be a competition for the common signaling repressors and activators of the inflammatory ligand TNF and anti-inflammatory ligand Il-10 at approximately 4 h of signaling.\n",
      "It is also worthwhile to note that if TNF pathways dominate, it should lead to increased Il-10-repressed genes and direct the cells into the apoptosis pathway.\n",
      "In addition to this effect, we observed upregulation but not enhanced levels of NF-κB p105, implicating this subunit in KDO and IFN-β responses not only through IκB-NF-κB interaction but also through transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "The elevated KDO and IFN-β primary and secondary responsive genes were not unexpected, considering that we observed higher NF-κB signaling and endogenous production of IFN-β under double-ligand stimulation.\n",
      "This suggests that there exists some crosstalk and pathway modulation in a positive way that increased the levels of gene expression.\n",
      "Macrophages, when infected with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, lead to the induction of about 1,000 genes, and almost all of these genes were reported to be induced only though the TLR4 signaling cascade.\n",
      "Excessive production of cytokines or inflammatory agents is always associated with sepsis and shock.\n",
      "The data presented in our microarray also show that KDO and LPS induce identical gene expression profiles.\n",

      "cAMP-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms may be involved in mediating the gene regulation during double-ligand stimulation with KDO and 8-Br.\n",

      "Ccl3, Ccl4, Il-1β, Tnf-α, and Gadd45β are the genes whose promoters have been proven to be regulated by RelA [49].\n",

      "We tried to find answers through the promoter and transcription factor search analysis.\n",
      "Transcription factors evolved to regulate the gene expression, and they have the ability to modify the expression of a given gene.\n",
      "Since Tnf is downregulated by 8-Br at 60 min itself, it should be happening either at the promoter level or at the primary pathway level.\n",
      "Although Tnf has AP1 binding sites, it is not sufficient to induce Tnf mRNA, whereas NF-κB is necessary for its upregulation.\n",

      "This indicates the powerful role of PDE4B in macrophages, by inhibiting cAMP and its critical role in LPS signaling.\n",
      "Another possible explanation for this pathway modulation is the interaction between NF-κB and PKA.\n",
      "Since the catalytic subunit of PKA works as a complex with NF-κB/IκB in the inactive state [55], stimuli that degrade IκB also activate the associated PKA catalytic subunit, which promotes the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser 276 and increases the transcriptional activity of NF-κB.\n",
      "Two GPCR ligands, isoproterenol and prostaglandin E2, induce cAMP through the activation of Gαs and adenylate cyclase.\n",
      "cAMP production inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF and nitric oxide in RAW 264.7 cells [56, 57].\n",
      "Apart from this, multiple signaling pathways or mechanisms are likely to be involved in mediating gene responses to KDO and 8-Br.\n",
      "In some cases, an increase in cAMP level by pituitary adenylate cyclase blocks IκB degradation, p65/Rel translocation, and/or the rearrangement of CREB/Jun/CREB-binding protein (CBP) complexes [58].\n",
      "In other cases, an increase in cAMP is directly proportional to the decrease in MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) kinase pathways [59], and transactivating properties of PKA are reported to be involved in NF-κB activation [60].\n",
      "After 60 min, triple-ligand treatment upregulated many transcription factors, such as Nr4a2, Crem, Atf3, Irf8, Nfkbp100, Egr2, Egr1, Cish, Stat3, Stat2, Irf1, and FosB.\n",
      "After 120 min of stimulation, we observed upregulated zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 32 (Zbtb32), Fosl1, RelB, Irf7, LPS-induced TNF-α factor (Litaf), and Jundm2.\n",
      "Although the regulatory mechanisms of these genes are complex, they all culminate in the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n",
      "NIH3T3 cells, when stimulated with the cAMP analog forskolin, activate p38 by PKA, which in turn phosphorylates CREB through RSK2.\n",
      "However, this process is delayed in comparison with the direct phosphorylation of CREB by PKA [61].\n",
      "This study shows that there exist crosstalk mechanisms between PKA and p38, thus allowing the cells to prolong the incoming signal.\n",
      "Both LPS and the cAMP analog 8-Br activate p38, like forskolin, forming the crosstalk points between GPCR and Toll-like receptor.\n",
      "This mechanism would have partly contributed to the observed dominant gene signature of KDO in triple-ligand studies.\n",
      "We also noted that there exist substantial differences in the gene expression profiles of RAW 264.7 cells and primary macrophages.\n",
      "For example, TNF alpha is produced highly in RAW 264.7 cells than in macrophages, and there are quantitative and temporal differences between these cells.\n",
      "The KDO-induced gene signature dominated over IFN-β and the 8-Br-induced gene signature.\n",
      "In addition, we also explained the genes that have the ability to act as positive (Tnf, Il-1) [62, 63] and negative feedback (Il-1ra) [64] regulators of KDO signaling.\n",
      "Excessive activation of cytokines is associated with septic shock and clinical consequences of inflammatory disorders.\n",
      "It is also of interest that many genes induced by 8-Br have the potential to act as anti-inflammatory actions.\n",
      "Thus, our studies prove that elevating intracellular cAMP levels during the times of immunological stress might ameliorate the shock-induced mortality.\n",
      "Taken together, our study identified several target genes that are activated/repressed by KDO, IFN-β, and/or 8-Br in RAW 264.7 cells.\n",
      "Based on these data, we also proposed regulatory signaling networks that could be responsible for the crosstalk between Toll-like receptors and non-Toll-like receptors, such as GPCRs.\n",
      "These findings not only highlight the decisive regulation of various genes by three important ligands but also add depth to our broad understanding of biological signaling connections between complex systems of functionally interacting macromolecules.\n",
      "Gene responses in macrophages to LPS vary between different methylation patterns [65], sub-clones of RAW 264.7 cells [66], chromatin structure of gene promoters, and chromatin remodeling events [67].\n",
      "To define the action of a given ligand, it is necessary to rule out these options and particularly emphasize on the true effects of a ligand.\n",

      "However, when multiplying each beta-coefficient by the number of corresponding risk alleles, negative values of beta-coefficients may be obtained in some genotypes of the SNPs.\n",
      "Therefore, it may affect the OR values for CRC when compared to the OR values for CRC determined using counted GRS.\n",

      "[31] and Ripatti et al.\n",
      "[32] used methods similar to the GRS created for our study.\n",

      "Aston et al.\n",
      "[41] suggested that a score based on 90 SNPs in 78 genes can predict the risk of breast cancer, but the identity of the SNPs and the algorithm for calculating the score remain proprietary.\n",
      "An alternative way to calculate GRS using machine approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), could be introduced, as SVMs have already been used to deal with many biological problems, such as DNA expression profiles [42].\n",
      "Still, further studies are needed to use machine learning approaches, such as SVMs, for the calculation of GRS.\n",
      "To our knowledge, there have been no studies evaluating a GRS using SNPs contributing to CRC for the prediction of the disease in the Korean population.\n",
      "The present study evaluated a prediction model using counted GRS or weighted GRS together with conventional risk factors, such as age and family history of CRC among Koreans.\n",
      "The risk of CRC is said to increase in individuals with a family history of CRC, in particular those >50 years of age [43, 44].\n",
      "From a recent study, a CRC prediction model was developed with known major risk factors of age, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and physical activity level for middle-aged Japanese men [17].\n",
      "Another recent study on the prediction model of CRC included an individual's age, sex, history of CRC, sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy, polyps, family history of CRC, smoking, physical activity, aspirin/NSAID use, vegetable intake, BMI, and hormone replacement in women [16].\n",
      "In our study, the prediction model of CRC was comprised of conventional risk factors, such as age and family history of CRC, together with the GRS.\n",
      "As determined, inclusion of counted GRS or weighted GRS revealed improved estimates of CRC prediction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors, such as age and family history of CRC.\n",
      "For example, when counted GRS were added to the prediction model of CRC consisting of age and family history of CRC, the AUC increased by 4.2% in men and 5.2% in women, whereas the AUC increased by 3.2% in men and 4.8% in women when weighted GRS were added to the same model.\n",
      "Studies showing significant relationships of GRS in conjunction with coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast cancer have reported that considering the contribution of multiple SNPs may improve the predictive value of GRS for such diseases [18, 31, 45].\n",
      "In other words, combining multiple loci with modest effects into a global GRS might improve identification of persons who are at risk for such diseases [23-25].\n",
      "For example, in the ARIC study, the contribution of multiple SNPs into a single GRS was responsible for an improvement in the prediction of incident CHD [18].\n",
      "In a study that used counted GRS or weighted GRS to determine the risk for type 2 diabetes in US men and women, individuals in the highest quintile of GRS had a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to those in the lowest quintile; however, the addition of GRS increased the AUC by only 1%.\n",
      "In this instance, the GRS was determined to be useful when combined with the joint effects of BMI and counted GRS or family history of diabetes and counted GRS [30].\n",
      "In our study, individuals in the highest quartile of GRS had increased risk of CRC compared to those in the lowest quartile of GRS for both men and women.\n",
      "In addition, in strata of family history of CRC and GRS, this increase was even higher in individuals with a family history of CRC in the highest quartile of GRS compared to those without a family history of CRC in the highest quartile of GRS in both men and women.\n",
      "Still, there were statistically significant interactions in men but not in women.\n",
      "In this study, the most commonly used conventional risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, were also not included in the prediction model of CRC, as smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, and WC did not significantly interact with the GRS.\n",
      "Therefore, further studies are needed to verify these results.\n",
      "A family history of CRC is commonly used as a surrogate marker for determining genetic susceptibility to CRC and remains one of the strongest risk factors for the disease [10, 31, 46].\n",
      "Approximately 25% of all CRC cases occur in individuals with a family history of the disease and no genetic disorders [47].\n",
      "In addition, some retrospective studies have suggested that a history of CRC in a first-degree relative (a parent or sibling) elevates a person's lifetime risk of CRC from 1.8-fold to 8.0-fold [10, 47].\n",
      "This family history risk factor may encompass both genetic and shared environmental components [31].\n",
      "In our study, after controlling for age and GRS, the strong relationship between family history of CRC and risk of CRC persisted.\n",
      "These findings suggest that other risk loci remain to be discovered or that family history has a much larger shared environmental component than previously thought [31].\n",
      "Our study was not without limitations.\n",
      "The cross-sectional design precluded the determination of causality, and a prevalent case bias may exist due to the higher number of prevalent cases (n = 165) of CRC included compared to the number of incident cases (n = 22).\n",
      "Combining prevalence and incidence cases could introduce survival biases.\n",
      "Still, the 5-year survival rate for CRC in Koreans was 71.3% in 2009 while that in Americans, Europeans, and Japanese was 65.0%, 56.2%, and 65.2%, respectively [43].\n",
      "It could be said that Koreans have higher survival rates for CRC compared to other ethnic populations.\n",
      "Additionally, this study is also a case-cohort study.\n",
      "Blood samples of prevalent cases used in this study were from baseline, and incidence cases during the follow-up period, suggested as prevalent cases in this study, might have been missed, as other blood samples were not taken.\n",
      "Therefore, those prevalent cases at baseline might have become incident cases or mortality cases during the follow-up period.\n",
      "It is hard to say if this study was performed among survivors.\n",
      "Another limitation included a self-reported family history of CRC, thus precluding the definitive exclusion of potential misclassifications.\n",
      "The statistical power of the current study might be too low, as genotyping was performed separately for men and women.\n",
      "In addition, performing multiple tests separately in both men and women may increase error rates.\n",
      "Although CRC affects men and women equally, gender differences in CRC may exist.\n",
      "For example, regarding colorectal polyps and tumors, men had a greater risk of polyps (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.64) and tumors (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.68) than women.\n",
      "In addition, women had greater number of purely right-sided polyps and tumor development [48].\n",
      "Therefore, detection of genetic effects separately in men and women may be needed.\n",
      "In addition, age differences in case and control participants may also increase error rates, as control participants may become CRC patients when they reach the case age.\n",
      "This study also involved the lack of validation and replication of the current study results.\n",
      "Therefore, it is hard to say that there may have been a true association between GRS and CRC in Korean men and women.\n",
      "However, bootstrapping and 10-fold cross validation were used for internal and external validity of this current study.\n",
      "Furthermore, although sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy history was the strongest risk factor in the previous study, this current study did not include it as one of the conventional risk factors of CRC.\n",
      "Cases included in this study were also relatively small.\n",
      "This study also excluded cases ≥ 55 years of CRC onset age to obtain early-onset CRC cases.\n",
      "Therefore, estimate effects of cases ≥ 55 years of CRC onset age were hard to be seen in this study.\n",
      "Finally, most SNPs found to be associated with CRC among the study population were not similar to those SNPs found in relation to CRC among other populations.\n",
      "It also could be due to differences in ethnic population and the ages of case participants included in this study (cases < 55 years).\n",
      "Nevertheless, this relatively large-scale study demonstrated the effectiveness of the prediction model of CRC using the GRS consisting of only SNPs that associated significantly with CRC and evaluated the effects on the risk for CRC in combination with conventional risk factors, such as family history of CRC, with the GRS.\n",
      "Moreover, the present study included the Korean population, whereas previous studies involving CRC prediction models using conventional risk factors or the relationship of genetic risk factors to CRC were limited to white and Japanese populations [17, 20-22].\n",
      "In conclusion, our findings suggest that the prediction model of CRC revealed improved prediction estimates when age, family history of CRC, and the GRS in the Korean population were included.\n",
      "Furthermore, when compared to those in the lowest quartile of GRS in the presence or absence of a family history of CRC, the risk of CRC was found to be significantly increased in individuals with a family history of CRC in the highest quartile of GRS.\n",
      "However, it was statistically significant in men but not in women.\n",
      "Findings in this current study might provide a small piece of evidence in prediction of CRC for reducing its prevalence and incidence rates.\n",

      "To identify the genetic association with gastric cancer, we selected 17 SNPs sites in folate pathway-associated genes of MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR and tested in 1,261 gastric cancer patients and 375 healthy controls.\n",
      "By genotype analysis, estimating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI), rs1801394 in the MTRR gene showed increased risk for gastric cacner, with statistical significance both in the codominant model (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.85) and dominant model (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75).\n",
      "Especially, in the obese group (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2), the codominant (OR, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 94.59) and recessive model (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 0.92 to 16.59) showed dramatically increased risk (p < 0.05).\n",
      "In conclusion, rs1801394 in the MTRR gene is associated with gastric cancer risk, and its functional significance need to be validated.\n",
      "According to the Korea Central Cancer Registry data, gastric cancer is ranked as the most common cancer in Korean and men and accounted for about 20.1% of all cancers in Koreans.\n",
      "In Korea, 29,727 cases of gastric cancer were newly diagnosed, and the crude incidence rate of gastric cancer in 2009 was 59.9 per 100,000.\n",
      "In males, the number of newly diagnosed cases and incidence rates of stomach cancer in 2009 were 19,953 cases and 80.2 per 100,000, respectively.\n",
      "The 5-year relative survival rates of gastric cancers were increased by 22.5% from 42.8% in 1993-1995 to 65.3% in 2005-2009 [1].\n",
      "Evidence from pathology and epidemiology studies has provided a human model of gastric carcinogenesis with the following sequential stages: chronic gastritis; atrophic gastritis; intestinal metaplasia; and dysplasia [2].\n",
      "Also, an environmental element of gastric cancer occurrence exists plentifully.\n",
      "The best well-known risk factors for gastric cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection, by far the strongest established risk factor for gastric cancer; a family history; and smoking.\n",
      "Several factors related to nutrition and food preservation, such as high intake of salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite or low intake of fruit and vegetables, are likely to increase the risk of gastric cancer [3].\n",
      "Cancerogenesis, which is the loss of cellular differentiation that leads the digestive tract to cancer, is inhibited by nutrition factors, such as retinoid, vitamins B-complex (including folate), vitamin C, D3, and E, polyphenol, fiber, calcium, selenium, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., Omega-3) [4].\n",
      "Especially, the environmental factors in cancer and a high intake of vitamin B-complex play important roles in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation [5].\n",
      "There have been many epidemiological studies that gastric cancer is associated with high-risk dietary profiles (low folate, vitamin B6 intake, and high alcohol), smoking, and low blood folate concentration [6-8].\n",
      "Folate is the water-soluble form of vitamin B9 in foods [9].\n",
      "Leafy vegetables, such as spinach, turnip greens, lettuces, dried beans, peas, fortified cereal products, sunflower seeds, and certain fruits, are rich sources of folate.\n",
      "The recommended dietary allowance for adults is 400 µg of food folate a day, which is equivalent to about 240 µg synthetic folic acid in supplements or fortified food.\n",
      "Women of child-bearing age planning a pregnancy should take 400 µg synthetic folic acid daily in addition to their normal dietary intake [10, 11].\n",
      "There is now substantial data to support an important role for folate in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), Down syndrome, vascular disease, various cancers, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive function, and affective disorders [12].\n",
      "Cumulative evidences suggest that food containing folate decreases the risk of colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers [13].\n",
      "Also, a western lifestyle, which is associated with high total caloric or fat intake (include red meat), and inactive life pattern, has been considered one of the main reasons for increasing trends of cancer in Koreans [14].\n",
      "Variations in levels of serum total homocysteine (tHcy) can result from genetic or nutrient-related disturbances in the folate pathway.\n",
      "In this mechanism, fasting levels of tHcy mainly reflect the remethylation pathway.\n",
      "In the remethylation pathway, the primary methyl donor for the vitamin B12-dependent conversion of Hcy to methionine is 5-methlytetrahydrofolate, which in turn forms 5, 10-methlytetrahydrofolate by means of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).\n",
      "Recent reports suggested that individual genetic variation or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various genes involved in cellular folate metabolism or transport may also be implicated in cancer risk.\n",
      "In the folate metabolism pathway, cellular folate act as donors and receptors of methyl groups in the biosynthesis of nucleotide precursors used for DNA synthesis and provide methyl groups for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins [15].\n",
      "MTHFR, methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR), and methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) genes are well known for their association with the folate pathway [16,17].\n",
      "MTHFR maps to chromosome 1p36.3 and is 2.2-kb long and contains 11 exons.\n",
      "The gene product is a 77-kD protein, although a smaller isoform of approximately 70 kD has been observed in some tissues, such as liver [18].\n",
      "SNPs in MTHFR, such as C677T (rs1801133), A1298C (rs1801131), and G1793A (rs2274976), have been suggested to be associated with several cancers (colon, gastric, and breast), cardiovascular disease, NTDs, and pregnancy complications [6, 9, 19-21].\n",
      "In cancer patients, higher sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) among patients carrying the MTHFR 677TT and 1298AA genotypes compared to the others was reported, demonstrating a strong predictive ability of these polymorphisms in response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in gastric cancer [22, 23].\n",
      "The MTRR gene was mapped to human chromosome 5p15.3-p15.2, is 34 kb long, comprises 15 exons, has 22 codon SNP (cSNP) variation sites, and is thought to produce cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNA isoforms [24, 25].\n",
      "Polymorphisms in MTRR-rs1801394 (A66G), rs1532268 (S175L), and rs10380 (H595Y)-have been associated with the risk of cancers (breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Down syndrome, and Alzheimer disease [26-31].\n",
      "The MTR gene maps to human chromosome 1q42, is 105 kb, comprises 33 exons, and has 116 SNP variation sites.\n",
      "One polymorphism in MTR (rs1805087) has been associated with colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk [8, 32].\n",
      "For gastric cancer, a genetic variation in MTHFR has been recently reported [33, 34].\n",
      "Also, case-control studies with specific results on folate intake (or blood concentration) and gastric cancer risk suggest a protective role in a couple of reports [35, 36].\n",
      "The MTR or MTRR gene variations were associated with colorectal and pancreatic cancer risk [8, 37], but there has been no report on gastric cancer.\n",

      "After defining the CNV loci using the 3 different algorithms, we assessed how many of them overlapped with each other, and we also validated the CNVs by genomic quantitative PCR.\n",
      "Through this analysis, we proposed that for reliable CNV-based genomewide association study using SNP array data, CNV calls must be performed with at least 3 different algorithms and that the CNVs consistently called from more than 2 algorithms must be used for association analysis, because they are more reliable than the CNVs called from a single algorithm.\n",
      "Our result will be helpful to set up the CNV analysis protocols for Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 genotyping data.\n",
      "Human genome variation has facilitated the understanding of inter-individual phenotypic differences [1, 2].\n",

      "Genomewide SNP genotyping data can be used for CNV calling [4]; therefore, if we can get reliable CNV calls from the SNP genotyping data, a CNV-based genomewide association study (GWAS) can be realized.\n",
      "Among many whole-genome CNV analysis platforms, SNP arrays have been suggested as a resource for CNV discovery due to their ubiquitous genome coverage and relatively advantageous resolution.\n",

      "To verify the specificity of the PCR reactions under the unified denaturation temperature (60℃), we performed PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis for each primer set.\n",
      "We also screened the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) to confirm the unique sequence without any repeat sequences in the primers.\n",

      "All PCR experiments were repeated twice, and amplification efficiencies for both target and reference genes were evaluated using a standard curve over 1:5 serial dilutions.\n",
      "The copy number of each target was defined as 2-ΔΔCT, where ΔCt is the difference in threshold cycles for the sample in question normalized against the reference gene (RNaseP) and expressed relative to the value obtained by calibrator DNA (NA10851 and Promega DNA), as described elsewhere [28].\n",
      "The general characteristics of the CNV calls from the 3 algorithms are shown in Table 2.\n",

      "The size of the CNVs consistently detected by 2 or more algorithms was generally bigger than that of the CNVs detected by a single method.\n",
      "For example, the average sizes of the CNVs that were detected from all 3 algorithms, 2 algorithms, and 1 method were 107 kb, 73.2 kb, and 15.9 kb, respectively (Table 3).\n",
      "Fig.1 shows the examples of different sizes of CNVs according to the LRR distribution of gain- and loss-type CNV regions, depending on how many algorithms detected the CNV in that region.\n",
      "These data suggest that larger-sized CNVs are generally more prominent; so, they can be relatively easily detected by any segmentation method, regardless of the algorithm.\n",
      "But, detection of the smaller-sized CNVs can be affected more easily by the characteristics of the CNV defining algorithm; so, they can be detected by 1 particular algorithm.\n",
      "A recent report examining the impact of inaccuracy of CNV detection from SNP genotyping data revealed that CNVs, defined as the copy number changes of >7 consecutive probes, were fairly reliable in case of deletion type CNVs [29].\n",
      "In our previous study exploring the CNV profiles of Koreans using an Affymetrix array, we suggested the filtering condition of CNV call as >6 consecutive probes to be reliable [5].\n",
      "Therefore, to make more reliable conditions in this study, we filtered the CNV calls as >7 consecutive probes.\n",
      "Under this criterion, the number of CNV calls from the 3 algorithms was reduced down from 295 to 385, while the median size became bigger-50 kb by PennCNV and QuantiSNP and 23.5 kb by BirdSuite (Table 2).\n",
      "In this condition, same as above, the size of the CNVs consistently detected by 2 or more algorithms was generally bigger than that of the CNVs detected by a single method (Table 3).\n",
      "In terms of the number of CNVs consistently identified by different algorithms, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV algorithm, 48.6% (396/814 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms, and only 4.9% (40/814 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms.\n",
      "Similarly, of the CNV calls using QuantiSNP, 42.9% (466/1,087 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and only 3.9% (42/1,087 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms.\n",
      "However, in the case of the BirdSuite algorithm, although the number of CNV calls was the biggest, only 9.6% (131/1,362 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and 2.9% (40/1,362 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms.\n",
      "Taken together, only 17% of the total CNV calls (465/2,735 CNVs) were defined by more than 2 algorithms, and only 1.5% (40/2,735 CNVs) was defined by all 3 algorithms (Table 3).\n",
      "In the filtering condition of >7 consecutive probes, the number of CNVs consistently identified by different algorithms was improved.\n",
      "For example, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV algorithm, 76.6% (226/295 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and only 23.4% (69/295 CNVs) was detected uniquely by PennCNV.\n",
      "QuantiSNP calls showed a similar trend.\n",
      "However, even under this condition, 92.5% (356/385 CNVs) of BirdSuite calls were unique (Table 3).\n",
      "All the CNVs consistently detected by 2 algorithms were from PennCNV and QuantiSNP, while no CNVs that were detected by the BirdSuite algorithm were consistently detected by 2 algorithms, with only 1 exception.\n",
      "These data suggest that CNV calls from SNP genotyping depend substantially on the characteristics of calling algorithms, and only part of the CNV calls from each algorithm seems to be reliable.\n",
      "Therefore, CNVs identified from SNP genotyping data must be validated as completely as possible, and especially in the case of using a single calling algorithm, the CNVs must be validated more carefully.\n",
      "Filtering the CNV calls by the number of consecutive probes can improve the reliability of CNV calls.\n",
      "To validate the CNVs identified from 3 different algorithms in this study, we randomly selected 25 CNV regions across the whole chromosomes.\n",
      "The genomic qPCR validation results are listed in Table 4.\n",
      "In case of the CNVs identified by all 3 algorithms, 71.4% (5/7) of the consistency was observed between the CNV call and genomic qPCR result.\n",
      "Of the CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms, 57.6% (19/33) was consistent.\n",
      "Of the unique CNV calls defined by just a single algorithm, only 38.3% (18/47) was consistent, but the other 61.7% (28/46) was not consistent.\n",
      "In the case of the CNVs defined as >7 consecutive probes, the consistency was generally improved-47.8% (unique CNVs), 62.2% (CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms), and 83.3% (CNVs identified by all 3 algorithms).\n",
      "These results indicate that CNV calls from 2 or more algorithms are more reliable than those from single algorithms.\n",
      "CNV calls from all 3 algorithms are, of course, the most reliable, but this is too stringent; so, the number of CNVs is not applicable for GWAS analysis.\n",
      "In this study, we aimed to verify the effect of adopting multiple CNV calling algorithms and set up the most reliable pipeline for CNV calling with Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 data.\n",
      "We found that CNVs defined by a single CNV calling algorithm may not reliable enough for further GWAS study, regardless of the types of algorithms.\n",
      "Based on our findings, we propose that for reliable CNV-based GWAS using SNP array data, CNV calls must be performed with at least 3 different algorithms, and the CNVs consistently called from more than 2 methods must be used for association analysis.\n",

      "Title: Application of Whole Exome Sequencing to Identify Disease-Causing Variants in Inherited Human Diseases\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has dramatically changed the nature of biomedical research.\n",
      "Human genetics is no exception-it has never been easier to interrogate human patient genomes at the nucleotide level to identify disease-associated variants.\n",
      "To further facilitate the efficiency of this approach, whole exome sequencing (WES) was first developed in 2009.\n",
      "Over the past three years, multiple groups have demonstrated the power of WES through robust disease-associated variant discoveries across a diverse spectrum of human diseases.\n",
      "Here, we review the application of WES to different types of inherited human diseases and discuss analytical challenges and possible solutions, with the aim of providing a practical guide for the effective use of this technology.\n",
      "Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a technique to selectively capture and sequence the coding regions of all annotated protein-coding genes.\n",
      "Coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, it enables the analysis of functional regions of the human genome with unprecedented efficiency.\n",
      "Since its first reported application [1, 2], WES has emerged as a powerful and popular tool for researchers elucidating genetic variants underlying human diseases (Fig.1) despite certain limitations (see below).\n",
      "WES pipelines generally follow a similar process, regardless of the capture method and NGS platform used, as summarized in Fig.2.\n",
      "The experimental pipeline can be divided into two parts: 1) preparing genomic DNA libraries and hybridizing them to capture arrays and 2) NGS of the eluted target fragments.\n",
      "There are a number of commercially available capture arrays, and their strengths and weaknesses have been well described elsewhere [3].\n",
      "Once short sequencing reads have been generated, they are mapped to the reference human genome, and variant calling is carried out.\n",
      "Subsequent annotation of these variants is necessary to further evaluate their potential biological effect; publicly available software and databases can be used for this purpose.\n",
      "WES is a robust technology that is extremely practical for investigating coding variation at the genome-wide level.\n",
      "Despite the plummeting cost of sequencing in the past few years, WES at mean coverage depth of 100× still costs five times less than whole genome sequencing (WGS) at mean coverage depth 30×.\n",
      "In addition, the size of WES data per patient is approximately a sixth of WGS data, resulting in reduced processing time and imposing less of a burden in terms of data storage.\n",
      "However, it is important to understand the limitations of WES technology.\n",
      "Certain protein-coding regions might not be covered due to incomplete annotation of the human genome.\n",
      "Further, WES does not cover potentially functional non-coding elements, including untranslated regions, enhancers, and long-noncoding RNAs, although these are, in themselves, not clearly defined.\n",
      "Another drawback to WES is the limited ability to detect structural variations, such as copy-number variations, translocations, and inversions.\n",
      "In spite of these limitations, WES is still the tool of choice for many researchers-its practical advantages allow large numbers of patients to be screened in a robust fashion, a crucial aspect of mutation discovery in human genetics research.\n",
      "WES has been used in identifying genetic variants associated with a variety of diseases.\n",
      "Here, we discuss different categories of inherited human disease and the methodology employed to examine each case.\n",
      "Diseases inherited in a recessive pattern have traditionally been highly amenable to genetic analysis, due to the fact that homozygous variants are easily detectable.\n",
      "Previously, if a large family with many affected members was available for pedigree analysis, one would perform linkage analysis by genotyping family members in order to identify relatively short genomic intervals that presumably contained the disease-associated variant.\n",
      "Direct interrogation of entire genomes for homozygous variants is now possible with NGS technologies, and public datasets can be used to exclude common variants that are less probable to be disease-causing.\n",
      "Identifying recessive variants is especially straightforward if the proband is a product of a consanguineous marriage-sequencing the entire exome of the patient would likely yield a manageable number of rare homozygous variants, and further studies could be performed to investigate the functional relevance of these variants.\n",
      "In one of the earliest reports of the application of WES technology, Bilgüvar et al.\n",
      "[4] identified recessive mutations in WDR62 in multiple Turkish consanguineous patients with severe developmental brain defects.\n",
      "Very little was known about WDR62 at that time, but subsequent genetic and functional studies have since validated the importance of this gene in proper brain development.\n",
      "More recently, a large cohort of patients of similar genetic status and clinical manifestation were analyzed using homozygosity mapping from WES data [5].\n",
      "The authors uncovered 22 genes not previously identified as disease-causing, further demonstrating the power of WES as an ideal tool for gene discovery.\n",
      "Mendelian diseases with dominant modes of inheritance pose greater technical challenges for genetic analysis.\n",
      "Heterozygous variants are generally more difficult to detect and analyze, not only due to their sheer number as compared to homozygous variants but also because they are subjected to higher false positive and false negative errors.\n",
      "Nevertheless, one could still design one of the following experiments to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying these diseases, depending on the availability of patient cohorts and the effect of the disease on reproductive fitness.\n",
      "Title: Familial cohort\n",
      "\n",
      "If large families with the disease of interest are available, WES should be performed on at least two affected family members.\n",
      "In analyzing the results, any shared variants could potentially be disease-causing; using linkage data to focus on the variants located in linked intervals would greatly reduce the number of variants to be considered.\n",
      "A recent example of such an approach is a WES study on familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) [6].\n",
      "The authors recruited two large families with FALS and selected two affected members with the greatest genetic distance from each family for WES.\n",
      "Among the rare functional variants that were identified, they tested the shared variants for Mendelian segregation among affected family members, eventually narrowing their search down to a single common gene, PFN1.\n",
      "Title: Non-familial cohort\n",
      "\n",
      "When large families with the disease are not readily available, one could perform WES on a number of unrelated patients with similar clinical manifestations and select genes that are commonly mutated in the patient cohort.\n",
      "In carrying out such an experiment, it is important to consider the background mutation burden of the entire human gene set; it is possible that the longest genes might contain the highest number of rare functional variants and therefore appear to be the most interesting.\n",
      "To circumvent such errors in analysis, the variant burden of each gene should be normalized using data from a control population.\n",
      "In a WES study of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), the variant burden of every gene from 11 unrelated patients was compared against that of 699 controls [7].\n",
      "A single gene that was specifically enriched for mutations in the patient set, KLHL3, was identified (5 variants from 11 patients compared to 2 from 699 controls, with p-value of 1.1 × 10-8).\n",
      "Title: Non-inheritable diseases\n",
      "\n",
      "If the disease phenotype is severe enough such that it affects reproductive fitness, one could hypothesize that de novo variants-variants that emerged during meiosis of the germ cells that are unique to the offspring-are directly associated with the disease.\n",
      "These can be detected by performing trio-based WES on the unaffected parents and the proband, and variants that are present in the offspring only and not in the parents will be called de novo variants.\n",
      "The rate of de novo mutations has been shown to be relatively stable and affected primarily by paternal age [8].\n",
      "WES of family quartets can also be carried out, where unaffected siblings are recruited simultaneously and their de novo mutations are compared against those of the proband.\n",
      "A series of studies involving autism trios and quartets recently demonstrated that rare de novo mutations were associated with the risk of autism and identified multiple de novo mutations in SCN2A, KATNAL2, and CHD8, implicating these genes in the genetic etiology underlying autism [9-11].\n",
      "The majority of the disease burden that modern societies endure can be attributed to common complex diseases.\n",
      "These diseases typically have both genetic and environmental causes, and they also possess significant genetic heterogeneity, making the identification of disease-causing genes very challenging.\n",
      "Traditionally, the use of linkage analysis of families with extreme disease phenotypes has been somewhat successful in mutation discovery [12].\n",
      "However, these mutations are particular to patients with extreme phenotypes and do not explain the pathophysiology of disease for patients in the general population.\n",
      "Large genome-wide association studies of common variants have also been employed with limited success; the findings in many studies are not robust and only explain a small fraction of the disease risk [13].\n",
      "As a result, greater attention has been drawn to profiling rare variants with allele frequencies of less than 1% in complex diseases.\n",
      "Taking advantage of WES technology, several large-scale projects have been launched.\n",
      "One such example is a project led by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to discover novel genes underlying cardiovascular disorders.\n",
      "As a result of sequencing the exomes of 2,440 individuals, the study reported an excess of rare functional variants and concluded that large numbers of subjects will be required to attain sufficient power to discover variants that are significantly associated with the disease traits [14].\n",
      "WES yields extensive lists of genomic variation, and there are many important caveats to bear in mind when carrying out analysis of such data.\n",
      "In this section, we address the potential challenges that the investigators need to consider when designing or performing the experiments.\n",
      "Recent improvements of the WES technique in both experimental and bioinformatics pipelines have reduced the occurrence of false positive (false variant that is called true) and false negative (true variant that is failed to be called) variant calls substantially.\n",
      "Currently, we can achieve ~98% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity from exome sequencing data, minimizing the chance of missing any true variants as compared to the analysis of SNP array data (data not shown).\n",
      "However, as mentioned previously, it is technically challenging to detect and evaluate rare heterozygous variants because heterozygous variant calling is more susceptible to the technical errors and require higher read depth.\n",
      "For example, at a coverage depth of 4× (i.e., if a base is covered by 4 independent reads) and assuming a 1% per-base error rate, a homozygous variant will be called if 0 and 4 reads are observed for the reference and nonreference alleles respectively, with a false positive rate of 2 × 10-4.\n",
      "However, if both reference and nonreference alleles have 2× coverage, a heterozygous variant will be called with a false positive rate of 0.34.\n",
      "This presents a particular problem when one considers the uneven coverage in WES resulting from differential capture efficiencies across the exome.\n",
      "To achieve reliable heterozygous calling, it is therefore necessary to achieve sufficient coverage depth across the entire exome so as to minimize the number of bases with low coverage.\n",
      "Another challenge to analysis is read misalignments; the typical length of NGS reads is near or less than 100 bp, and even paired reads are subject to being improperly aligned, because there are large portions of the human genome where the DNA sequence is highly repetitive and duplicated.\n",
      "In fact, segmental duplicated regions, defined as intervals larger than 1 kb having a homology >90% with other parts of the genome, encompass about 5% of the human genome [15].\n",
      "Hence, imposing more rigorous filtering criteria to remove such reads, including Phred score and mapping quality score cutoffs, is essential.\n",
      "The recent, dramatic acceleration in human population growth over the last several millennia has resulted in an excess of rare variants in the human genome, and these variants have not had enough time to be subjected to natural selection [14].\n",
      "Since the identification of disease-associated variants consists largely of assessing rare variants, one must bear in mind the possibility that a variant of interest could be population-specific and not necessarily disease-causing.\n",
      "This is especially problematic if the patient cohort is not of European or, more specifically, northwestern European descent.\n",
      "Recent public sequencing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project and NHLBI Go Exome Sequencing Project, have covered a greater variety of non-European ethnic groups than before, and they report that these groups harbor a greater burden of rare variants as compared to Europeans [14, 16].\n",
      "For example, indigenous African individuals may carry 2-3 times more rare variants, and East Asian individuals may carry 1.5 times more variants when compared to individuals of European descent.\n",
      "Rare variants specific to the population of study might be easily mistaken as patient-enriched variants; it is thus necessary to screen the presumed variant with carefully matched healthy individuals.\n",
      "Locus heterogeneity describes the phenomenon where a single disease can be caused by multiple different loci across different patients.\n",
      "Over the last few decades, studies performing linkage analysis followed by positional cloning have identified many genes as being responsible for various inherited diseases; the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database currently records 3,000 genes as being disease-causing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim).\n",
      "This also suggests that the majority of the remaining diseases without known associations with genes have not been amenable to classical approaches and will likely display extensive genetic heterogeneity.\n",
      "Increasing the size of the patient cohort will increase the power to discover variants, as shown in Fig.3.\n",
      "Pathway or gene ontology analyses can also be performed to link the mutated genes into certain functional categories-there are several publicly available tools for this purpose.\n",
      "A good example of this method is the aforementioned study on PHAII-the authors initially identified KLHL3 from WES of 11 patients and subsequently considered KLHL3's presumed functional partner, CUL3, as a potential gene candidate.\n",
      "Extending the screening to 52 patients, KLHL3 was found to be mutated in 24 patients (46.2%) and CUL3 in another 17 patients (32.7%), explaining a total of 78.8% of the entire patient set.\n",
      "Another possible approach is to re-evaluate the clinical diagnosis of patients in the cohort by correlating subtle differences of clinical measurements and genetic variants in order to focus the analysis on a more clinically homogeneous set of patients as a separate cohort.\n",
      "There is no doubt that NGS has provided researchers with unprecedented power to resolve the genetic etiology of various human diseases.\n",
      "When WES was first introduced, its utility was highly debated due to its apparent limitations, such as incomplete coverage of functional elements and low sensitivity for structural variant detection.\n",
      "However, the practical advantages of the technology have made it a favored tool for researchers, and WES will likely continue to be widely used for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Furthermore, as library capture methods and data analysis pipelines improve, increasing amounts of genomic information, aside from single-nucleotide changes and short indels, can be extracted.\n",
      "Examples of this include homozygosity interval mapping, common SNP genotyping information for various population-level analyses, and detection of structural variants [17, 18].\n",
      "Finally, the strengths of WES-short turnaround times, low cost, and relatively easy data interpretation-make it an optimal tool for clinical diagnosis.\n",
      "The increased use of WES in the clinic will surely spur the development of personalized medicine and reinvent treatment practices in the near future [1, 19].\n",

      "A variety of large-scale human genome studies were done as projects to revolutionize medicine and cope with the aging society.\n",
      "In April 2000, SRC started collaboration with the Human Genome Center (HGC), Institute of Medical Science (IMS), University of Tokyo, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).\n",
      "Its mission was to identify up to 150,000 SNPs throughout the human genome within two years, to make the information available to the public, and to develop analytical tools for polymorphisms (note: SRC was renamed Center for Genomic Medicine [CGM] in 2008 [http://www.src.riken.jp/]).\n",
      "SNPs are the most common form of DNA sequence variation.\n",
      "They are the most useful and convenient polymorphic markers to map genes that modify disease susceptibility or those related to drug responsiveness.\n",
      "If we had a dense catalog of SNPs, we could narrow down the loci relating common disease susceptibilities to a small region containing one gene or so by linkage disequilibrium mapping.\n",
      "To get such a catalog, the discovery of a large number of SNPs was first necessary [2].\n",
      "The draft sequence was published in 2001 [3].\n",
      "It was a collaborative work of the public sector via the international Human Genome Project (HGP) and the private sector via Celera Genomics.\n",
      "HGP refers to the international 13-year effort, formally begun in October 1990, to discover all the human genes and make them accessible for further biological study.\n",
      "Another project goal was to determine the complete sequence of the human genome.\n",
      "Actually, the latter group led by Dr. Craig Venter, was the critical player for the success of finishing the sequence, which invented the strategy of the shotgun sequence, followed by computational assembly [4].\n",
      "It was a revolution in genomic research.\n",
      "With the help of the draft sequence, Japanese Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (JSNP), the first population-specific SNP database (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), was established as a collaborative work of HGC-IMS and JST [5].\n",
      "A total of 190,562 genetic variations (mainly SNP) in 24 subjects were discovered and confirmed and have been made available through this website [6].\n",
      "Based on information in the JSNP database, Tanaka's group in SRC succeeded in identifying a susceptibility gene for myocardial infarction [7].\n",
      "This study was the first GWAS in the world [8, 9].\n",
      "By a two-stage association study-i.e., a GWAS followed by replication of a limited number of the SNPs with significant p-values-they found a functional SNP in the lymphotoxin-α (LTA) gene associated with myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Their GWAS was quite primitive by current standards.\n",
      "They used only ~100,000 SNPs from the JSNP database, because in those days, the number of genes was considered to be ~100,000, and basically, one gene is expected to be covered by one SNP.\n",
      "Both of these assumptions have been subsequently disproven by the HGP [10] and the HapMap Project [11].\n",
      "The coverage of the genome in the GWAS was low, because the success rate for this genotyping was only 71%.\n",
      "The estimated power (β value) for detection of a locus was also low, because the number of subjects was very small.\n",
      "However, the basic idea for the current GWAS, including linkage disequilibrium mapping for identifying the most associated SNPs and a pooled control strategy, were already present in the frontier study.\n",
      "Their study clearly showed that the GWAS was a reality, not the dream of statistical geneticists, and that a denser map of common SNPs was indispensable for realizing the dream.\n",
      "Completion of human genome sequencing was announced on April 2003.\n",
      "Reading of 99% of the gene-containing part of the human sequence was finished to 99.99% accuracy [10].\n",
      "However, in a true sense, the human genome sequence had (and has) not been finished.\n",
      "There are still many gaps in the \"reference\" sequence-for example, in the centromeres-and given the variation of the human genome sequence, many must wonder what the completion of sequencing the human genome is in the first place.\n",
      "After completion of the sequencing of the human genome, our center, SRC, joined The International HapMap Project from its start.\n",
      "The project was launched in October 2002 to create a public, genome-wide database of common human sequence variations, providing information needed as a guide to genetic studies of clinical phenotypes [2].\n",
      "The HapMap Project is a natural extension of the HGP.\n",
      "While the reference sequence of the genome constructed by the HGP is informative about the vast majority of bases that are invariant across individuals, HapMap focuses on DNA sequence differences among individuals.\n",
      "The main genome researchers in the world got together and made an infrastructure of the association study-i.e., a database of 1 million genetic variations for 4 representative populations: Africans, European Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese.\n",
      "The Africans were the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria.\n",
      "The European Caucasians were a Utah, USA population with Northern and Western European ancestry collected in 1980 by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH).\n",
      "The Chinese consisted of unrelated Han Chinese in Beijing, China.\n",
      "The Japanese were unrelated self-identified Japanese living in Tokyo, Japan.\n",
      "In the HapMap Project, we are proud to say that SRC made the World No.\n",
      "1 contribution as a research group by genotyping ~1/4 of the genome (Table 1).\n",
      "HapMap data document the generality of hotspots of recombination, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbors [11].\n",
      "There is the extensive redundancy among nearby SNPs, providing the potential to extract extensive information about genomic variation without complete re-sequencing, as well as efficiencies through selection of tag SNPs and optimized association analyses.\n",
      "After HapMap, GWAS became as easy as expected and intended; to perform a GWAS, we just collect DNA from patients, genotype it by using commercial arrays, and do a bit of statistics for the results (actually, in most cases, commercial companies do it for us as a business) (Fig.1).\n",
      "Genotyping has become work, not research; commercial genotyping systems have spread all over the world.\n",
      "By sharing the controls, collecting controls is no longer necessary, except for diseases with extraordinary high prevalence (>10%).\n",
      "A huge number of susceptibility genes are mapped by this 'easy' method.\n",
      "As a consequence, after HapMap, as commercial genotyping systems (Illumina, etc.)\n",
      "have spread, the association study has spread all over the world.\n",
      "As a result, a gold rush has come [1].\n",
      "The study of genetic polymorphisms (SNP, copy number variation, etc.)\n",
      "with its application to disease studies was selected for the No.\n",
      "1 scientific event in the year 2007 [12].\n",
      "Naturally, the application refers to the identification of susceptibility genes for common diseases by GWAS.\n",
      "You must have seen (and are still seeing) so many GWAS papers in good journals, which have reported susceptibility genes for so many common diseases, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis.\n",
      "For example, Nature Genetics is one of the top journals in the field of genetics, with an impact factor in 2010 of 36.377, and in that year, it published a total of 181 papers, of which 56% was GWAS-related.\n",
      "So, for the journal, the genetic study is almost equal to the association study.\n",
      "There came such a big wave of medical science, and of course, we got on the wave.\n",
      "We did so many GWASs that were the first for diseases, including GWASs for osteoarthritis [13], rheumatoid arthritis [14], and diabetic nephropathy [15].\n",
      "The big wave has also spread to East Asia.\n",
      "Many good GWAS papers have been published from Korea and China as fruit of this international collaboration [16-18].\n",
      "Good days are ending, however.\n",
      "Today, the initial enthusiasm for GWASs is decreasing, and the GWAS society is facing severe criticisms.\n",
      "A frequent complaint is that GWAS results mean little to patients due to the small effect of variants on disease risk and their relatively small contribution to common disease etiology.\n",
      "This claim might be partially correct.\n",
      "In the first place, \"significantly associated\" does not mean that the association identified by the study is significant in biology, medicine, or actual life.\n",
      "For example, a paper reported the identification of a SNP that is associated with height, but its estimated additive effect is only 0.44 cm on height [19].\n",
      "Another example of dubious significance is a GWAS study claiming that cartilage thickness of the hip joint measured on X-ray films is decreased in subjects with a susceptibility allele; they have a 0.07-mm (not cm!)\n",
      "narrower joint space than those who do not have the allele [20].\n",
      "However, the low risk (low odds ratio) is not always due to the GWAS itself.\n",
      "In many studies, it is the problem of particular studies themselves, not of the GWAS.\n",
      "For examples, using pooled controls of general populations as controls of highly prevalent diseases, like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity, must decrease the odds ratio of the susceptibility alleles because of contamination of the patients in the controls.\n",
      "Also, ambiguous definition of populations, like \"UK Caucasians\" or \"Western Europeans,\" would compromise the result by admixture of different ethnic subgroups.\n",
      "Thus, it is necessary to detect population stratification prior to association analysis.\n",
      "Moreover, a GWAS is not a method to conclude something.\n",
      "It's a method to map the gene: an associated variant is not necessarily a true causal variant.\n",
      "GWASs present candidates of the causal variant.\n",
      "To identify and prove the causality, we need to find the best associated variations by fine mapping around the smoking gun GWAS signal, followed by functional studies for them.\n",
      "Statistics must lead to biology.\n",
      "Biology must lead to medicine.\n",
      "It is true that after all, no treatment, no benefit, to the patients has been given for common diseases from GWAS results so far.\n",
      "My comment is not intended to look down on GWASs.\n",
      "It is a method to start something; it gives us wonderful start points.\n",
      "You can start the work based on the reality of the disease-clinical evidence (patient, clinical record) from the human evidence in front of you-to the patients at your bedside.\n",
      "Another problem is that not infrequently, the interpretation of the 'mapping' results is wrong.\n",
      "In many studies, authors just make a story for causality by relating to known genes near the marker SNPs, even if they are far apart on the genome.\n",
      "The association does not tell which gene is implicated; it just tells which sequence variation is wrong.\n",
      "Some of the readers might be thinking that all genes have already been discovered by the international genome project.\n",
      "This is totally wrong.\n",
      "There are still many more genes that have not been identified.\n",
      "For example, we have found a novel susceptibility gene, DVWA, that is associated with osteoarthritis [21].\n",
      "DVWA was in a gene desert region when we first found it in 2004.\n",
      "While we were working on cloning it [21, 22], a computer-predicted gene was mapped to the region; however, the prediction was a mess.\n",
      "The number of coding exons was predicted to be 19, while it was actually 3.\n",
      "Only 1 in 7 experimentally determined exons of DVWA had been correctly predicted regarding the exon-intron boundary and coding region (Fig.2).\n",
      "We also found a novel susceptibility gene for osteoporosis, FONG [23], which was not predicted correctly in the public database.\n",
      "GWASs can be a starting point to find a hidden gene in the genome, and we should remember that now, the concept of the \"gene\" itself is changing.\n",
      "We have already known that there are so many non-protein-coding genes: the genes encoding functional RNAs [24].\n",
      "They are quite compatible to the original concept of the gene: information in the genome that determines phenotype or trait.\n",
      "To code proteins is just one of the many ways to determine phenotype.\n",
      "GWASs have so many false positives.\n",
      "p < 10-2 (1% significance level) means a 1 in 100 coincidence.\n",
      "If you try 1,000 times, you can hit 10 targets and 100,000 times, 1,000 targets-all quite by chance.\n",
      "Therefore, association needs replication, but repeating in the same population is not a good idea; it might just introduce the same error in the first study, which is sometimes difficult to detect.\n",
      "Studies in different populations, preferably in populations from different ethnic groups, are desirable.\n",
      "Because one population is one experiment of nature, one ethnic group is one experiment given from heaven.\n",
      "Every experiment is precious.\n",
      "Multiple replications in large samples provide the most straightforward path for identifying robust and broadly relevant associations.\n",
      "International collaboration is necessary.\n",
      "For international replication, East Asia has a definite advantage when we consider its relative genetic similarity among the subpopulations, large population size, and high medical standard of the countries in the area.\n",
      "Currently, most people look at GWASs as a method to identify a marker for genetic diagnosis and risk assessment.\n",
      "Yes, by knowing the genetic risk, we can re-evaluate and modify our lifestyle and prevent unhappy problems, like side effects of drugs.\n",
      "However, GWASs could give us far sweeter fruit.\n",
      "Through functional analysis of a gene and its associated variants, we can approach the mechanism of the disease.\n",
      "By studying the meaning of allelic differences of causal variants, we can clarify the molecular pathogenesis of the disease.\n",
      "With the knowledge of the pathogenesis, we can walk directly to develop innovative treatments and discover new drugs (Fig.3).\n",
      "Therefore, identification of the significantly associated SNP is just 'end of the beginning' to get to the final goal: treatment of patients with common diseases.\n",
      "However, at present, after identification of 'marker' SNPs by GWASs, we have no golden road to find 'causal' SNPs (variants).\n",
      "We have no customized method to identify functional variants.\n",

      "Title: Transposable Elements: No More 'Junk DNA'\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the advent of whole-genome sequencing, transposable elements (TEs), just thought to be 'junk' DNA, have been noticed because of their numerous copies in various eukaryotic genomes.\n",
      "Many studies about TEs have been conducted to discover their functions in their host genomes.\n",
      "Based on the results of those studies, it has been generally accepted that they have a function to cause genomic and genetic variations.\n",
      "However, their infinite functions are not fully elucidated.\n",
      "Through various mechanisms, including de novo TE insertions, TE insertion-mediated deletions, and recombination events, they manipulate their host genomes.\n",
      "In this review, we focus on Alu, L1, human endogenous retrovirus, and short interspersed element/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) elements and discuss how they have affected primate genomes, especially the human and chimpanzee genomes, since their divergence.\n",
      "Transposable elements (TEs), mobile segments of genetic material, were first discovered by McClintock [1].\n",
      "Since then, they have been identified in a variety of eukaryotes [2].\n",
      "Recent genome sequencing projects have consistently shown that TEs make up ~50% of primate genomes, while coding DNA occupies only ~2% of the genomes [3-5].\n",
      "TEs are generally divided into two categories, DNA transposons and retrotransposons (Fig.1), based on their manner of mobilization.\n",
      "DNA transposons move using a cut-and-paste mechanism [6].\n",
      "In contrast, retrotransposons move in a copy-and-paste fashion by duplicating the element into a new genomic location via an RNA intermediate [7].\n",
      "Thus, retrotransposons increase their copy number more rapidly than DNA transposons.\n",
      "Retrotranspons include short interspersed element (SINE), long interspersed element (LINE), and human endogenous retrovirus (HERV).\n",
      "Alu and short interspersed element/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) elements are primate-specific retrotransposons, and their full-length is 300 bp and 2 kb, respectively.\n",
      "The Alu element is the most successful SINE in terms of its copy number; ~1.2 million Alu copies exist in the human genome.\n",
      "LINE is ~6 kb in length, and thus, it is much longer than the SINEs.\n",
      "This element has two open reading frames encoding enzymatic machineries essential for the propagation of the three elements; the Alu element depends on reverse transcriptase of LINE for making their dispersed copies in the host genome [8].\n",
      "In contrast to SINE and LINE, which do not have long terminal repeats (LTRs), the full-length HERV (~10 kb) has two LTRs, and three genes-gag, pol, and env-are located between them [8, 9].\n",
      "Studies on active TEs have suggested that the elements could alter gene expression by providing cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites [10].\n",
      "Through these mechanisms, altered transcriptional activity could lead to dysfunctional and abnormal proteins.\n",
      "Through de novo TE insertion within a gene, TEs could alter a gene product, which could be either harmful or beneficial to its host genome [11, 12].\n",
      "In cases where an inserted TE causes a harmful effect on its host genome, the TE is likely to go to inactivation and fossilization by evolutionary accumulation of mutations and silencing effects [13].\n",
      "Since the divergence of the human and chimpanzee, ~6 million years ago, many TEs have propagated in each genome.\n",
      "Among them are the Alu, L1, SVA, and HERV-K (HML-2) elements.\n",
      "During the past 6 million years, 5,530 Alu, 1,835 L1, 864 SVA, and 113 HERV-K (HML-2) elements are estimated to have been newly inserted in the human genome (Table 1) [8, 14, 15].\n",
      "These elements could act as an agent causing human-specific genomic rearrangements via de novo TE insertions, TE insertion-mediated deletions, and homologous recombination events [12, 16-19].\n",
      "Furthermore, some of the recent integrated TEs are capable of producing new copies in the human genome.\n",
      "These de novo TE insertions have the potential to cause a genomic difference among human populations and even human individuals, which could be related to human phenotypes and diseases [20].\n",
      "In this review, we describe species-specific TEs and discuss how they affect their host genomes, focusing on illustrating the mechanisms that they utilize with examples.\n",
      "Taken together, we suggest that TEs, often called 'junk' DNA, in fact have many functions and play a significant and dynamic role in primate genomic evolution.\n",
      "Comparative genomics allows us to investigate species-specific TEs.\n",
      "Through a combinational method of computational data mining and experimental verification, species-specific TEs have been well studied in various primate genomes, including human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque.\n",
      "During the past 6 million years, more than 10,000 human-specific TEs were newly inserted in the human [21].\n",
      "The majority of the identified elements belong to Alu, L1, and SVA retrotransposons.\n",
      "These elements have contributed to the genomic difference between human and non-human primates through insertion and post-insertion recombination between the elements [8, 22].\n",
      "Alu elements are most ubiquitous in the human genome.\n",
      "A master gene model has been generally accepted to explain the amplification of Alu elements.\n",
      "In the model, only limited numbers of hyperactive \"source\" or \"master\" genes are able to produce a high number of Alu copies over evolutionary time.\n",
      "One of the previous studies about the AluYb subfamily, one of the most active Alu subfamilies in the human genome, found that the copy number of AluYb elements is very different between human and non-human primates; a high copy number of AluYb elements exists in the human, but a very small number of the elements exists in non-human primates [23].\n",
      "The oldest AluYb element resides at its orthologous position in all hominid primate genomes, demonstrating that the AluYb subfamily emerged 18 to 25 million years ago.\n",
      "Then, after approximately 20 million years of retrotranspositional quiescence, a major expansion of the subfamily occurred only in the human genome within the past several million years.\n",
      "To explain their successful proliferation in the human genome, a new model, \"stealth driver,\" was introduced.\n",
      "In this model, a high copy of the Alu elements could be driven at least in part by \"stealth driver\" elements, which maintain low retrotransposition activity over extended periods of time.\n",
      "Although this element has low retrotransposition activity, they have the potential to produce short-lived hyperactive copies responsible for the remarkable expansion of AluYb elements within the human genome [24].\n",
      "L1 is another successful element, occupying ~17% of the human genome.\n",
      "The copy number of Alu elements is much higher than that of L1 (Alu, ~1.2 million copies; L1, ~520,000 copies).\n",
      "Nonetheless, Alu elements are responsible for ~11% of the human genome, because the Alu element is much shorter than L1 (Alu average length, 300 bp; full-length of LINE, 6 kb) [25].\n",
      "Through characterization of sequence diversity of chimpanzee-specific L1 subfamilies as compared to their human-specific counterparts, it was concluded that L1s experienced different evolutionary fates between humans and chimpanzees within the past ~6 million years.\n",
      "Although the species-specific L1 copy numbers were on the same order in the two species (1,800 human-specific L1s vs. 1,200 chimpanzee-specific L1s), the number of retrotransposition-competent elements was much higher in the human genome than in the chimpanzee genome.\n",
      "The species-specific L1s were grouped into several L1 subfamilies.\n",
      "All human L1 subfamilies belonged to a single lineage, but two distinct L1 lineages were identified in the chimpanzee genome [15].\n",
      "SVA is shared only in human and apes.\n",
      "Fewer than 1,000 copy numbers were detected in orangutan (~15 million years ago), and no SVA detected in Old World monkeys indicating SVA is a hominid-specific element.\n",
      "Like Alu elements, SVA elements retrotranspose to another locus in trans by using reverse-transcriptase encoded by L1s [8].\n",
      "Due to the limited mobilization and short evolutionary time, the copy number of SVA is very small compared to Alu and L1 elements [15, 26, 27].\n",
      "There are six SVA subfamilies (SVA_A to SVA_F) in the human genome.\n",
      "The older, SVA_A to SVA_D, evolved in a single lineage, whereas human-specific SVA_E and SVA_F were derived independently from their ancestral sequences.\n",
      "The copy number of SVA was estimated throughout the primate genomes of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla, and there was no significant difference among them.\n",
      "The two elements, Alu and L1, showed a huge expansion at a specific evolutionary time along the primate lineage, but SVA still did not show any burst in its copy number [26, 27].\n",
      "The comparison of human and chimpanzee genomic sequences showed that the two genomes have a much higher sequence identity than we expected [3, 4].\n",
      "In spite of the sequence similarity, TEs have remarkably generated genomic differences between the two species since their divergence [22].\n",
      "Many studies have suggested that a number of TEs are still active to retrotranspose and have the potential to cause genomic variations as a major driver [12, 16-19, 28].\n",
      "In reality, TEs have rearranged human and non-human primate genomes through various mechanisms, such as de novo TE insertion, TE insertion-mediated deletion, and homologous recombination between them (Fig.2) [29].\n",
      "These genomic changes caused by TEs have increased the genomic difference between human and non-human primates, and some of the human-specific genomic rearrangements caused human diseases [28, 34].\n",
      "Advanced sequencing technology, including next-generation sequencing, and combined computational analyses have accelerated the studies on the dynamics of TE mobilization [35].\n",
      "In reality, human-specific TEs have been continuously investigated, and the majority of them are Alu, L1, and SVA elements [8, 14].\n",
      "The relationship between human brain evolution and Alu elements was studied.\n",
      "Since the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages, the human brain has rapidly changed in terms of mass [36].\n",
      "It is not an exaggeration to say that Alu elements are in part responsible for the human brain mass.\n",
      "Interestingly, de novo Alu insertions have been identified in many human brain genes that are related to neuronal functions and neurological disorders [37].\n",
      "The inserted Alu elements belong to AluYa5, AluYb8, and AluYc1, which are human-specific Alu subfamilies [37].\n",
      "Approximately 1,800 human-specific L1s were identified in the human genome [15].\n",
      "They belonged to two different subfamilies, pre-Ta and Ta; Ta is subdivided into Ta-0 and Ta-1 by diagnostic nucleotides [38].\n",
      "Among hominid-specific SVA subfamilies, SVA_E and SVA_F are only detected in the human genome, but the other four subfamilies, SVA_A, SVA_B, SVA_C, and SVA_D, are shared in human and other apes, including chimpanzee and gorilla [26].\n",
      "HERV appeared in the primate genome through germ-line infection [30].\n",
      "There are approximately 98,000 HERVs in the human genome.\n",
      "Full-length HERVs are ~10 kb in length, but most of the HERVS existing in the human are defective due to truncation and accumulation of mutations during primate evolution [39].\n",
      "Among various HERV subfamilies, HERV-K (HML2) is the youngest element in the human genome [8, 40]; 113 human-specific HERV-Ks were identified in the human genome, and among them, there were 15 and 98 full-length HERV-Ks and solitary LTRs, respectively [39].\n",
      "These de novo TE insertions showed polymorphisms among human populations and even human individuals [31, 39, 41, 42].\n",
      "Therefore, they have the potential to be used as a genetic marker for racial identification [31, 41, 42].\n",
      "De novo TE insertions contribute to the genome expansion.\n",
      "Actually, some of them somewhat decreased their host genomes involving the insertion-mediated deletion of host genome sequences [32, 33].\n",
      "Through comparative genomic analyses, 50 L1 insertion-mediated deletion events were found in the human and chimpanzee genomes [18].\n",
      "The sizes of the deleted sequences were variable, and in sum, ~18 kb and ~15 kb of sequences were removed from the human and chimpanzee genomes, respectively.\n",
      "Based on the result, it was estimated that L1 insertions may have deleted up to 7.5 Mb of target genomic sequences during the primate radiation.\n",
      "Alu insertions were also involved in the genomic deletions at its insertion target regions through Alu retrotransposition-mediated deletion.\n",
      "A total of 33 deletion events responsible for a ~9,000-bp deletion in human and chimpanzee genomes were identified.\n",
      "It was suggested that Alu retrotransposition may have contributed to over 3,000 deletion events, leading to a ~900-kb deletion during primate evolution [17].\n",
      "Additionally, 13 SVA insertion-mediated deletions (SIMDs) were also identified in the human genome, and they deleted 30,785 bp of the human genome compared with the chimpanzee genome (Table 1).\n",
      "Among the 13 SIMDs, 9 were associated with the SVA_D subfamily, occupying the largest portion of SVAs, which suggests that SIMD frequency is directly correlated to the copy number of SVA elements.\n",
      "Furthermore, one of the deletion events occurred in the tMDC II gene associated with sperm-egg binding prior to fertilization [43, 44].\n",
      "After TE insertions into the host genome, they could generate genomic variations through unequal homologous recombination events between them [17, 19, 43].\n",
      "The copy number of TEs is closely related to the frequency of the recombination between them.\n",
      "Thus, compared to other TEs, Alu and L1 elements have a high probability of generating genomic structural variations due to their ubiquity.\n",
      "In reality, 492 Alu recombination-mediated deletions (ARMDs) were identified in the human genome, and they deleted ~400 kb of human genomic sequences (Table 1).\n",
      "About 60% of the deletion events were related to known or predicted genes, including three that deleted functional exons.\n",
      "Thus, the ARMD process has produced a considerable portion of the genomic and phenotypic variations between humans and chimpanzees since the divergence of the two species [16].\n",
      "The recombination between L1 elements has also deleted human genome sequences.\n",
      "Seventy-three L1 recombination-associated deletions (L1RADs) were identified in the human genome [45].\n",
      "The sizes of the deletion events range from 56 to 64,113 bp, and ~450 kb of human genomic sequence was deleted through this L1RAD process (Table 1).\n",
      "Thus, the L1RAD event has deleted 25 times as much human genomic sequence as the L1 insertion-mediated deletion event [18, 45].\n",
      "The TEs inserted in intra- and inter-genic regions could alter cellular gene expression, increasing genomic instability [9].\n",
      "About a decade ago, gene regulation by TEs was studied only in specific genes through experimental validation.\n",
      "However, genome-wide analyses of gene regulation by TEs were recently conducted due to the developed high-throughput technologies.\n",
      "The findings showed that TEs have many regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, and cryptic splicing donor (5') and acceptor (3') sites, by which the transcript architecture of nearby genes can be altered [10, 46, 47].\n",
      "When TEs insert into the intronic region of genes, they could create a new exon by offering splicing sites, and this process is called \"exonization\" [48].\n",
      "This mechanism is related to exon variations, such as cassette exons and intron retention in exons, increasing mRNA instability [49].\n",
      "The TEs residing upstream of any gene could act as an alternative promoter, leading to new alternative transcripts with a new transcriptional start site [10].\n",
      "Some TEs carry bidirectional promoters with transcription factor binding sites.\n",
      "For example, LTR and L1 have sense promoters initiating their transcription and antisense promoters having the potential to initiate the transcription of other genes in the opposite direction [50, 51].\n",
      "There is a microRNA gene cluster in human chromosome 19 (C19MC), over 100 kb in length.\n",
      "This cluster consists of the duplication of a core cassette, including a minus-strand Alu element.\n",
      "The cluster grew successfully during primate evolution, and the Alu element promotes microRNA expression by RNA polymerase III [52].\n",
      "TEs not only initiate transcription but also terminate it by offering a polyadenylation signal.\n",
      "A full-length L1 contains 19 polyadenylation signals that could cause premature mRNA truncation [53].\n",
      "The genes that contain TEs in their genic region have a tendency to produce various transcript forms, causing transcriptome diversity [10].\n",
      "The orientation of TEs could be a factor affecting gene expression, which is well described by a \"head-on collision\" hypothesis.\n",
      "During DNA replication, DNA polymerase collides with RNA polymerase transcription complexes moving in the opposite direction to the movement of the DNA polymerase.\n",
      "It was observed that the collision slows down the DNA replication [54].\n",
      "In cases where active TE exists in the opposite direction to its nearby genes, an RNA polymerase transcription complex transcribing the TE could encounter any of the RNA polymerase transcription complexes transcribing nearby genes, which could reduce the expression of the gene [54, 55].\n",
      "In reality, transcription of the E-globin gene is repressed by an Alu element that has been inserted in the opposite direction to the gene [56].\n",
      "On the other hand, TEs inserting in the same direction to its nearby genes show no effect on the expression of the genes [55].\n",
      "Histone modification plays an important role in gene transcriptional regulation, and through this process, the host genome could regulate the activation of TEs [57, 58].\n",
      "In reality, most TEs are accompanied by repressive histone modifications (e.g., H3K9me2 and H3K27me3), which cause the formation of heterochromatin.\n",
      "Conversely, TEs could affect the expression of host genes through histone modifications [59, 60].\n",
      "The level of histone modifications was calculated in all families of human TEs, and older TE families carried more histone modifications than younger families.\n",
      "Interestingly, TEs proximal to genes carry more histone modifications than the ones that are distal to genes, which suggests that some epigenetic modifications of TEs may serve to regulate the expression of host genes [61].\n",
      "DNA methylation is a strict silencing mechanism, and the host genome could use this process to repress the activation of TEs [61].\n",
      "In general, DNA methylation occurs in a CpG dinucleotide.\n",
      "Because Alu and SVA elements have a high degree of CpG dinucleotides, they are vulnerable to methylation [26, 62].\n",
      "It was observed that TEs regain their activity to mobilize and regulate the expression of host genes when the silencing effect becomes slackened with increasing genomic instability.\n",
      "In addition, the demethylation of TEs is associated with human diseases, commonly in cancer [63-65].\n",
      "miRNAs, one of the most active factors regulating gene expression, could be derived from TEs.\n",
      "Fifty-five genes derived from TEs were identified in the human genome, and their characterization showed that TE-derived miRNAs could potentially regulate the complex and dynamics of human genes [66].\n",
      "TEs have shown a variety of impacts on their host genomes.\n",
      "In this review, we describe HERV, Alu, L1, and SVA elements, which are thought to still be active in the human genome.\n",
      "A number of research studies related to TEs have shed new light on their amplification mechanisms and their function in primate genomes.\n",
      "Furthermore, recent research of TEs in the rhesus macaque genome provides a glimpse into their diversity and strong influence on the overall differences in genomic architecture between the Old World monkey (e.g., rhesus macaque) and hominid (e.g., human and ape) lineages [67].\n",
      "The occurrence of de novo TE insertions, TE insertion-mediated deletions, and post-insertion recombination between TEs within the human and chimpanzee lineages has caused genetic alteration, lineage-specific genomic rearrangements, and phenotypic variations, further contributing to the divergence of humans and chimpanzees.\n",
      "As a whole, this review calls into question whether TEs should be considered \"junk\" DNA at all.\n",
      "Rather, TEs represent a potent evolutionary force associated with genomic fluidity in their host genomes.\n",
      "Structures of transposable elements.\n",
      "These elements could be categorized into retrotransposons (Alu, long interspersed element [LINE], and human endogenous retrovirus [HERV]) (A) and DNA transposons (e.g., MARINER) (B) based on their manner of mobilization.\n",
      "In addition, autonomous elements (e.g., HERV and LINE) have coding genes responsible for their own mobilization but also other nonautonomous elements (e.g., Alu and short interspersed element/variable number of tandem repeats/Alu [SVA]).\n",
      "Alu consists of two monomers separated by an A-rich connector, one of which, the left monomer, includes internal RNA polymerase III promoter (A and B boxes).\n",
      "Full-length of LINE is ~6 kb and has open reading frames (ORFs) encoding RNA-binding protein, endonuclease, and reverse-transcriptase, which are flanked by untraslated regions (UTRs).\n",
      "ORF1 and ORF2 are separated by an ~60-bp-long intergenic spacer (IS).\n",
      "SVA contains a (CCCTCT)n hexamer, Alu-like sequences, variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), and short interspersed element-R (SINE-R).\n",
      "An arrow on Alu-like sequences indicates the direction of Alu.\n",
      "HERV has gag, prt, pol, and env genes flanked by a long terminal repeat (LTR), which encodes capsid protein, protease, polymerase, and envelop protein, respectively, used in viral infection.\n",
      "As an example of DNA transposon, mariner has a gene encoding transposase with a DNA-binding domain and catalytic domain flanked by an inverted repeat (IR).\n",

      "Genetic epidemiology studies have established that the natural variation of gene expression profiles is heritable and has genetic bases.\n",
      "A number of proximal and remote DNA variations, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), that are associated with the expression phenotypes have been identified, first in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and later expanded to other cell and tissue types.\n",
      "Integration of the eQTL information and the network analysis of transcription modules may lead to a better understanding of gene expression regulation.\n",
      "As these network modules have relevance to biological or disease pathways, these findings may be useful in predicting disease susceptibility.\n",
      "Genetic epidemiology is the study of the role of genetic factors in determining health and disease in families and in populations and the interplay of such genetic factors with environmental factors [1].\n",
      "Depending on the number of genetic factors that contribute to pathogenicity, genetic diseases are categorized into two classes.\n",
      "A so-called monogenic disorder is usually caused by a single gene mutation and has been the subject of intense gene hunting studies using familial linkages, totaling to more than 4,000 diseases being linked to causal mutations [2].\n",
      "Completion of the Human Genome Project expedited the studies of not only monogenic diseases but also complex diseases.\n",
      "The latter, also called polygenic or multifactorial diseases, are contributed by a number of genetic factors of relatively smaller effects.\n",
      "Unlike monogenic disorders that often affect only a small portion of a population and are consequently rarely observed, polygenic diseases are usually frequently observed in a population and are also termed common diseases.\n",
      "Chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and so on, belong to this category.\n",
      "The Human Genome Project paved the way to cataloging common variants in the human genome.\n",
      "The International HapMap Project is a global collaboration to map single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome and to construct haplotype maps that show which allele of a locus co-occur with which allele of another locus.\n",
      "Using three representative continental populations-that is, Africans, Europeans, and Asians-the international consortium cataloged roughly 1 SNP for every 300 bp of the human genome.\n",
      "The information of position, frequency, and correlation structure, called linkage disequilibrium of these SNPs, has enabled us to design high-density SNP chips that can measure the genotypes of fractions of those SNPs all at once and infer the genetic make-up of the major portion of the whole genome.\n",
      "Using these chips, genotypes of families or unrelated populations are measured, and the loci displaying statistically significantly different frequency patterns between disease-affected and unaffected groups are sought.\n",
      "Individuals harboring such alleles may have a higher or lower disease susceptibility than control groups.\n",
      "Scanning genome-wide associations of genotype-phenotype relationships is called a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and has become extremely popular, reporting more than 1,000 papers within the last 5-6 years [3], probably due to the hypothesis-free nature of its study design.\n",
      "While GWASs have been applied to studies of disease gene hunting, they are also well suited to interrogating genes affecting heritable phenotypes, such as height, obesity, plasma glucose concentration, blood pressure, bone density, and so on.\n",
      "Unlike disease studies where samples are segregated into case and control groups, these phenotypes display a continuous spectrum of values in normal populations.\n",
      "For s uch a quantitative trait, its statistical correlation with the genotypes within a population is sought, instead of dichotomizing the samples into case and control groups.\n",
      "The genomic loci that show correlations with such a trait are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs).\n",
      "According to the current estimate, the human genome harbors around 22,000 genes and 200,000 mRNA transcripts [4].\n",
      "One way that variations in the genomic sequence can exert phenotypic differences is through the alteration of structure and function of the gene products.\n",
      "Genetic variation may also result in changes in the expression levels of products and, thereby, their activities.\n",
      "Since most SNPs identified through GWASs do change the amino acid sequence of a protein, large portions of the genetic variation may be regulatory in nature.\n",
      "Differences in gene expression profiles between individuals then become molecular and intermediate phenotypes that in turn induce changes in higher-order disease traits [5].\n",
      "In fact, Cheung et al.\n",
      "[6] observed some genes showing markedly different expression levels between individuals and familial aggregation of expression phenotypes.\n",
      "In their follow-up study using 14 large families, they also identified approximately 1,000 expression phenotypes that showed significant evidence of linkage to specific chromosomal regions [7].\n",
      "Dixon et al.\n",
      "[8] also observed heritable expression patterns in about 30% of the genes and transcripts of their probes and identified the genomic regions where the genotypes were associated with those expression phenotypes.\n",
      "These are termed expression QTL (eQTL) and can be proximal (cis) or distal (trans) to the gene of expression variation (Fig.1).\n",
      "Other species also show eQTL.\n",
      "For example, eQTLs have been observed in recombinant inbred mouse strains [9-11], yeast [12, 13], and plants [14].\n",
      "The B-lymphoblastoid cell lines established by the International HapMap Project provide invaluable resources for the study of eQTL: for these samples, matched genotypes and expression profiles are publicly available.\n",
      "It is well known that genome-wide genotype profiles have the power to discriminate continental populations.\n",
      "Principal component analysis of the genotypes of the HapMap populations clearly clusters the individuals according to their population origins [15].\n",
      "On the other hand, it appears that the population difference in expression levels is negligible [16] or very small [17].\n",
      "For example, the expression levels averaged over each population are highly correlated between populations (Fig.2).\n",
      "Apparently, the within-group expression variance is much larger than the between-group variance.\n",
      "This is perhaps due to the fact that unlike genotypes that can drift somewhat freely without functional alteration, gene expression levels are tightly regulated by complex genetic programs.\n",
      "Instead of focusing on population differences in expression levels, intense effort has been made to cataloging eQTLs and classifying them into cis and trans.\n",
      "For example, using the HapMap samples of European and African ancestry, Duan et al.\n",
      "[18] found about 5,000 expression quantitative nucleotides (eQTNs) in each population.\n",
      "They used 4 Mb of distance between the gene and SNP as the criteria for classifying local and distant eQTNs and observed that genes harboring distant eQTNs were enriched with functions, like transmembrane signal transduction, implying roles in gene expression regulation [18].\n",
      "Stranger et al.\n",
      "[17] used all 270 HapMap samples to identify at least 1,348 and 180 genes showing cis and trans association signals, respectively.\n",
      "Their result is in sharp contrast to the previous estimate that counts most eQTLs as trans rather than cis [7].\n",
      "Veyrieras et al.\n",
      "[19] reanalyzed the HapMap data using a sophisticated Bayesian hierarchical model to resolve the eQTLs at a fine scale: most eQTLs lay either within genes or close to genes (<20 kb); eQTLs were enriched around transcription start sites and 250 bp upstream of transcription end sites, and exons were more likely to be eQTLs than introns.\n",
      "Their finding of enriched eQTLs upstream of transcription end sites is interesting, in that this site is related to post-transcriptional control and mRNA stability.\n",
      "This underscores the important role of mRNA stability besides transcription initiation in determining steady-state mRNA levels [19].\n",
      "The presence of cis-acting eQTLs for a gene implies that these alleles have different transcription levels or allelespecific expression.\n",
      "The typical microarray chips designed for expression measurement do not usually distinguish minute sequence differences of the SNP alleles residing within a transcript.\n",
      "One can infer the allele-specific expression using statistical tests that model the expression levels of a gene with the number of minor alleles at each locus.\n",
      "On the other hand, by hybridizing the transcripts onto SNP chips or directly sequencing the transcripts, one can validate the allele-specific expression.\n",
      "Ge et al.\n",
      "[20] used Illumina Human 1M Beadchips to measure allele-specific expression in 53 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from European descendants.\n",
      "With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has become popular and has been applied to detecting allele-specific expression.\n",
      "Pickrell et al.\n",
      "[21] sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated African individuals who participated in the International HapMap Project, discovering a number of eQTLs involved in allele-specific expression or allele-specific splicing.\n",
      "So far, most eQTL studies have examined expression-genotype relations in lymphoblastoid cell lines.\n",
      "Since many genes display tissue-specific expression patterns, one may argue that the expression-genotype relations observed in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines may not be preserved in other tissues or cell types.\n",
      "Gerrits et al.\n",
      "[22] observed that eQTLs were quite different, depending on the differentiation status of the cells, suggesting uncommon functional regulatory networks among different cell types.\n",
      "Nica et al.\n",
      "[23] compared cis-regulatory eQTLs from three different tissues of co-twin samples from the MuTHER project (http://www.muther.ac.uk/), observing 30% shared eQTLs, 29% exclusively tissue-specific eQTLs, and substantial differences in expression levels in different tissues.\n",
      "In addition to the similar proportion of exclusively tissue-specific cis-regulatory eQTLs from five different tissues, Fu et al.\n",
      "[24] also observed many examples of alternative regulation, where a gene is cis-associated with different SNPs, depending on the tissue.\n",
      "If one were to use eQTL information in predicting disease susceptibility, it is thus imperative to understand expression-genotype relations in the tissue of interest, not just in lymphoblastoid cell lines [25].\n",
      "When transcript expression levels were measured in adipose tissues as well as blood in large population cohorts, unlike expression profiles in blood, a marked correlation between expression levels in adipose tissues and obesity-related traits was observed [26].\n",
      "Schadt et al.\n",
      "[5] observed over 6,000 associations between genotypes and expression in 400 human liver samples to understand the genetic architecture of gene expression in the human liver, a metabolically important tissue involved in various common diseases, such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.\n",
      "We have reviewed above that natural variation in gene expression is substantial and heritable.\n",
      "Genetic analyses of expression phenotypes have identified cis- and trans-associated loci, culminating in our understanding of gene expression regulation.\n",
      "One should understand that not all genes showing natural variation are regulated by either cis- or trans-eQTLs.\n",
      "For example, genes downstream of eQTL-regulated genes in a regulatory network may also show natural variation.\n",
      "If they are regulated primarily by a regulator, their expression profile may resemble that of the regulator.\n",
      "On the other hand, if multiple regulators are involved, the downstream target genes may show complex expression profiles that may look independent of those of the regulators.\n",
      "Integrating the bioinformatic learning of regulatory programs and genetic analysis of cis- and trans-acting DNA variants may lead to a better understanding of gene expression regulation [27].\n",
      "Nayak et al.\n",
      "[28] constructed co-expression networks based on the HapMap expression profiles of African, European, and Asian ancestries, discovering that the subnetwork structures are not random but relevant to biological pathways or disease susceptibility.\n",
      "This implies that genes are regulated by a common set of regulatory modules and that the variable activity of the modules due to genetic variation can result in clustered expression profiles of the target genes.\n",
      "Li et al.\n",
      "[9], using 32 recombinant inbred mouse strains, reported 29 transcription modules and their associations with 18 classical physiological and behavioral traits, possibly through eQTLs.\n",
      "Individual variation in gene expression levels may be influenced by environmental and genetic factors.\n",
      "A substantial proportion of the variation is heritable and thus has a genetic basis.\n",
      "Based on studies on population-level genotype-expression data, it is now well established that DNA variations affect the expression levels of nearby or remote genes.\n",
      "Since the genotype data used in these studies were mostly measured on commercial SNP chip platforms of common variants, the causal eQTLs must be probed SNPs or located within the linkage disequilibrium blocks tagged by the probed SNPs.\n",
      "Whatever the case is, one may wonder whether those eQTLs evolved neutrally without any selection pressure or whether they were the result of selection over human population history.\n",
      "The co-expression network study by Nayak et al.\n",
      "[28] indicated that the subnetworks are modular and coherent in biological functions.\n",
      "It is very unlikely that such network structures were derived as the result of random drift in genomic variations.\n",
      "It is also interesting that evolutionary selection operated on a network or pathway level.\n",
      "Although they must have occurred gene by gene, the whole sum of the variations has biological themes.\n",
      "If the activity of the pathways is variable between normal individuals, it has an implication in predicting disease susceptibility.\n",
      "As the subjects probed by gene expression profiling are normal individuals, the variations of the pathway activity may not be large enough to trigger diseases.\n",
      "Nevertheless, they may predispose the genetic background of an individual to be susceptible or resistant to certain diseases.\n",
      "For example, individuals having slightly diminished immune pathway activities may have a high tendency of contracting infectious diseases or other immune-related diseases.\n",

      "In addition, both GDM women and their offspring are at increased risk of future development of T2DM.\n",
      "The heritability estimate of T2DM was reported to be quite high (h2 = 0.69) in a recent study performed in Europeans [11].\n",
      "These findings are indirect evidence that GDM has familial tendency.\n",
      "However, there is no study that has specifically evaluated the heritability of GDM using familial clustering or twins [12].\n",
      "It would be important to estimate the heritability of GDM and compare it with that of T2DM in women.\n",
      "During normal pregnancy, women experience increased adiposity and weight gain, which begin near mid-pregnancy and progress throughout the third trimester [13].\n",
      "In this period, insulin resistance ensues as a consequence of multiple factors, including increased production of placental growth hormone, estrogen, and tumor necrosis factor α [14, 15].\n",
      "Pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance can increase their β-cell insulin secretion in response to this increased insulin resistance during pregnancy.\n",
      "Although the mechanism of increased β-cell insulin secretion during pregnancy is not fully understood, it is reported that prolactin, which increases during pregnancy, can repress islet menin levels and stimulate β-cell proliferation in mice [16].\n",
      "In addition, recent reports suggest that β-cell serotonin signaling is also a major determinant of β-cell mass during pregnancy [17].\n",
      "It has been suggested from several clinical studies that GDM women have limited insulin secretion capacity that cannot compensate for the increased insulin resistance [13].\n",
      "Similar to GDM, T2DM is also characterized by relative deficiency in insulin secretion in the face of increased insulin resistance.\n",
      "Various factors, including increased age, obesity, high-fat diet, and sedentary lifestyle, can induce insulin resistance, and those who do not have sufficient β-cell insulin secretory capacity are more likely to develop T2DM [13].\n",
      "Therefore, it is said that a large proportion of GDM women are experiencing future T2DM in advance.\n",
      "Based on the findings that GDM women are at high risk of T2DM and both GDM and T2DM share similar pathophysiologies, it is reasonable to assume that they might also share similar genetic risk factors.\n",
      "Soon after the initial reports of T2DM genome-wide association (GWA) studies [18-21], several studies investigated whether genetic variants that were identified through GWA studies of T2DM were also associated with the risk of GDM [22, 23].\n",
      "Cho et al.\n",
      "[22] genotyped variants in or near CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, KCNJ11, and PPARG in 869 GDM women and 632 carefully selected nondiabetic control subjects.\n",
      "They found that genetic variants in CDKAL1 and CDKN2A/2B were highly associated with the risk of GDM (p < 1 × 10-6).\n",
      "In addition, variants in HHEX, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2 were all nominally associated with GDM (p < 0.05).\n",
      "Among a total of 18 genetic variants studied, 9 reached a nominal significance level (p < 0.05).\n",
      "In Fig.1, the risk allele frequency as well as the odds ratios of known T2DM variants are compared among a control group (n = 632, men : women = 287 : 345), T2DM group (n = 761, men : women = 354 : 407), and GDM group (n = 869) in Koreans [22, 24].\n",
      "For most of the variants, there was an increasing trend of risk allele frequencies from control to T2DM and from T2DM to GDM.\n",
      "Lauenborg et al.\n",
      "[23] also found that variants in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, and TCF2 were significantly associated with the risk of GDM in Europeans, consisting of 283 GDM women and 2,446 glucose-tolerant control women.\n",
      "Variants in KCNQ1, which were first identified in an East Asian T2DM GWA study, were also significantly associated with the risk of GDM in Koreans (p < 0.05) [25].\n",
      "Recently, it was reported that TPH1 and HTR2B play a crucial role in regulating pancreatic β-cell mass during pregnancy in a mouse model and that their genetic alterations could result in GDM [17].\n",
      "A total 6 genetic variants in HTR2B and 11 variants in TPH1 were identified and genotyped in Korean GDM women and control subjects [26].\n",
      "Although there were no significant associations of these variants with the risk of GDM, they were associated with measures of obesity and weight gain during pregnancy [26].\n",
      "Following these candidate approach studies was a two-staged GWA study that was performed in Korean GDM women [27].\n",
      "A total of 468 GDM women and 1,242 nondiabetic control women were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0.\n",
      "Variants that passed the prespecified p-value threshold in the stage 1 genome scan were further genotyped in 931 GDM women and 783 nondiabetic control women.\n",
      "Two variants, one located in an intron of CDKAL1 (rs7754840) and one near MTNR1B (rs10830962), were associated with a risk of GDM at a genome-wide significance level (p = 6.65 × 10-16 and p = 2.49 × 10-13, respectively).\n",
      "This was the first GWA study investigating the genetic risk factors of GDM.\n",
      "Although variants in MTNR1B have been previously reported to be associated with increased fasting glucose levels, the study was the first to report that MTNR1B variants are associated with GDM at a genome-wide significance level.\n",
      "One of the limitations was that it was not sufficiently powered to find truly novel genetic variants that were only specific in GDM.\n",
      "It should be noted that current GWA and GWA meta-analysis performed in T2DM recruits more than 100,000 cases and controls [28].\n",
      "One of the interesting findings was that genetic variants of T2DM were enriched in GDM subjects.\n",
      "Among the 34 confirmed T2DM genetic variants, 8 were associated with a risk of GDM [27].\n",
      "In addition, when the β-coefficients (or odds ratio) of the variants derived from the logistic regression were compared between GDM and T2DM, there was a significant positive correlation of β-coefficients between the two [27].\n",
      "These findings suggest that GDM and T2DM might share similar genetic backgrounds, at least in part.\n",
      "GWA studies have opened a new era in diabetes research.\n",
      "Our knowledge on the genetic predisposition of GDM as well as T2DM is expected to increase even faster as next-generation sequencing technology is applied to this field.\n",
      "There should be even larger GWA studies on GDM, and GWA meta-analyses should be available.\n",
      "In this way, we could find variants that have smaller effect sizes but are more specific to GDM than T2DM.\n",
      "In order to understand the genetic determinants of glucose and insulin concentration during pregnancy, genetic associations regarding these quantitative traits should be investigated.\n",
      "A fast way is to see whether genetic variants that are known to affect glucose or insulin concentration in the normal population also affect glucose or insulin concentration during pregnancy [29].\n",
      "In addition, a GWA study on glucose or insulin concentration during pregnancy should also be helpful.\n",
      "In this way, we would be able to better understand the pathophysiology of GDM.\n",
      "By definition, GDM encompasses women with pre-exiting T2DM, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), or even type 1 diabetes patients that were not diagnosed previously.\n",
      "It would be important to know the proportion of MODY patients that constitute GDM.\n",
      "In particular, about 15% of GDM patients remain diabetic at early postpartum periods, and a significant portion of these subjects might fall into the category of MODY.\n",
      "The contribution of genetic variants known to cause MODY, such as GCK and HNF1A, in GDM has been reviewed in recent literature [30].\n",
      "However, whole-exome sequencing will provide us with better bird's eye view on the contribution of MODY genes in GDM.\n",
      "In addition, it might be able to find novel MODY genes in those who have persistent diabetes after GDM pregnancy and also have a strong family history of diabetes.\n",
      "One of the first steps in translating the genetic information into clinical practice would be to predict the future development of T2DM in GDM women.\n",
      "GDM women are at particularly high risk of developing T2DM and require preventive measures and early screening of T2DM.\n",
      "Genetic information might improve our prediction of T2DM in women with a history of GDM.\n",
      "This is an area of active research [31, 32], and we are looking forward to studies that use genotype risk scores in predicting T2DM in GDM women.\n",
      "A similar approach could also be applied in predicting GDM, as more genetic variants associated with GDM are expected to be revealed.\n",
      "The functional consequences of the current common genetic variants identified through GWA studies of GDM are not well understood yet.\n",
      "It is not known whether they are markers in linkage disequilibrium with nearby causal variants or whether they have unknown but relevant functional roles.\n",
      "Next-generation sequencing might give answers to these questions, but a huge number of samples and much effort will be required.\n",
      "GDM women are at increased risk of developing T2DM and have familial clustering of T2DM.\n",
      "A common pathophysiology that is shared by GDM and T2DM is impaired compensatory increase in insulin secretion to overcome the increased insulin resistance.\n",
      "The GWA study of GDM enabled us to investigate the common genetic risk factors of GDM, and it revealed that GDM and T2DM share similar genetic backgrounds, at least in part (Fig.2).\n",
      "Although this information has significantly improved our insight in the pathogenesis of GDM, there are more unanswered questions remaining that should be explicitly expressed.\n",
      "Using the technology of next-generation sequencing, it is expected that more causal, rare variants will be identified.\n",
      "This genetic information would ultimately improve our prediction of GDM and future T2DM.\n",

      "Recently, the development of advanced genotyping technologies has allowed us to perform genome-wide association studies (GWASs).\n",
      "For detecting the effects of multiple genes on complex traits, many approaches have been proposed for GWASs.\n",
      "Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is one of the powerful and efficient methods for detecting high-order gene-gene (GxG) interactions.\n",

      "In particular, the nature of obesity is related with many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancers [6-8].\n",
      "In addition, it has been found that obesity may be caused by multiple genes, environmental factors, and those interactions [9-11].\n",
      "In order to identify the genes associated with obesity, body mass index (BMI) has been commonly used as an obesity-related phenotype or trait in GWASs.\n",
      "Many studies have reported that the genetic variants in FTO are associated with BMI [12, 13].\n",
      "Most of these studies have used the single single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach, in which each single susceptible locus is searched in association with obesity.\n",
      "The single SNP approach has long been used in detecting genetic traits, and it is especially optimal for Mendelian traits.\n",
      "However, complex traits are well known to be caused by multiple genetic factors as well as several environmental factors and their interactions.\n",
      "Thus, the single SNP approach is not appropriate for detecting multiple genetic factors affecting common complex polygenic traits.\n",
      "For the identification of multiple and joint genetic factors associated with complex traits, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method has been proposed by Ritchie et al.\n",
      "[14] and applied in detecting gene-gene (GxG) interactions [15, 16].\n",
      "However, their approach can be applied only to binary traits, and the covariates that may affect the phenotype can not be adjusted.\n",
      "In order to overcome these drawbacks, generalized MDR (GMDR) analysis was proposed by Lou et al.\n",
      "[17], in which both binary and quantitative traits can be considered phenotypes while adjusting for covariates.\n",
      "Although MDR and GMDR have been widely used to detect GxG interactions in genetic association studies, their applications have been mainly involved in dealing with candidate genes or a small set of genes.\n",
      "Since enormous computational complexity and high-speed computing resources are required in GWASs, neither MDR nor GMDR has been successfully applied to GWASs.\n",
      "In order to overcome these computational limitations, we previously proposed an efficient stepwise approach to identify GxG interactions for GWAS data [18] using cuGWAM, a graphic processing units (GPU)-based MDR program [19].\n",

      "This step can be achieved via several toolkits that support regression analysis, such as PLINK.\n",
      "Filtering by specific criteria, such as p-value, is subsequently performed in order to reduce the number of SNPs.\n",
      "With the selected SNPs from the single SNP association analysis, exhaustive two-way GMDR analysis is then applied.\n",
      "However, general toolkits supporting GMDR analysis can only handle hundreds of SNPs.\n",
      "Although the number of SNPs in this step can be reduced by giving more stringent criteria, it may ignore the SNPs having marginally less significant effects.\n",
      "In addition, a scheme to reduce overfitting, such as cross-validation, requires increased linear computation time.\n",
      "In order to solve this problem, faster toolkits are recommended, such as GPU-based GMDR analysis toolkits like cuGWAM [19].\n",
      "Since the number of combinations in GMDR analysis is usually very large, all results of GMDR can not be stored.\n",
      "Thus, a criterion is needed to store the specific interactions satisfying the criterion, such as balanced accuracy (BA).\n",
      "Title: Network graph construction\n",
      "\n",
      "Network graph is often used to visualize multiple sets of interactions.\n",
      "It consists of nodes and edges connecting two nodes.\n",
      "For simplicity of representation, we focus on two-way interactions.\n",
      "Since the two-way interaction is for the relationship between two variables, it can be easily represented as a graph that contains two nodes representing two variables of interaction and an edge corresponding to the interaction.\n",
      "According to this scheme, all interactions identified by GMDR analysis can be visualized in the network graph.\n",
      "However, this scheme can cause too complex a graph structure when the number of interactions is large.\n",
      "Thus, it is recommended to select a certain number of possible interactions in the network graph to reduce the complexity of the network graph.\n",
      "Alternatively, the complexity of the network graph can be reduced by gene mapping information.\n",
      "Since many SNPs are placed in a gene or adjacent to a gene, it is possible to annotate multiple SNPs into a single node of a gene according to their position.\n",
      "However, this approach requires a delicate mapping process.\n",
      "In addition, the network graph can represent the strength of the interaction by the thickness of the edge-that is, the higher the number of interactions between two nodes, the thicker the edge becomes.\n",
      "Title: Network graph analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to derive a reasonable biological interpretation of identified GxG interactions.\n",
      "Here, we propose a network graph analysis step to aid the biological interpretation of the identified GxG interaction by using existing biological resources.\n",
      "In other words, the goal of this step is to find known biological evidence that supports the identified GxG interactions.\n",
      "Resources used in this step consist of either a pair of a marker and target or two related markers, where a marker corresponds to a gene or SNP and a target represents a biologically proven target related with a marker.\n",
      "From a resource with marker and target information, such as HuGENet [21], miRBase [22], and is-rSNP [23], we simply assume that there is biological evidence if two SNPs within an interaction share the same biological target defined in the biological resource.\n",
      "For resources, such as COXPRESdb [24], having information about the correlation among genes, we assume that all correlated genes in these resources have biological interactions.\n",
      "Although this is a naïve assumption, the use of these resources is mainly to support the interactions identified by GMDR analysis.\n",
      "Note that many known biological resources have their own unique data structures that differ from each other.\n",
      "Consequently, the integration of multiple resources is recommended in order to provide further biological evidence for a given GxG interaction.\n",
      "In our GMDR analysis using KARE data, we first performed the single SNP association test via PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) using a linear regression model with covariate adjustment of age, area, and sex.\n",
      "We used the p-value from linear regression as a criterion of screening and used a p-value threshold of 3 × 10-1 for the screening process; 101,837 SNPs were carried out after the screening process, as a result of the single SNP association test.\n",
      "The top 10 SNPs with the smallest p-values are listed in Table 1.\n",
      "The GMDR analysis was then performed using our GPU-based software, cuGWAM [19], in order to evaluate all possible two-way interactions and used a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, with covariate adjustment of age, area, and sex.\n",
      "An exhaustive search for two-way interactions from the selected SNPs took 19 h on the GPU system with three GTX285 graphic cards.\n",
      "In this step, a total of 51,853,363,660 possible two-way interaction models were evaluated.\n",
      "In GMDR analysis, 10-fold cross-validation was used.\n",
      "For each cross-validation set, the top 10,000 interactions with the highest test BAs were selected, where BA is defined as the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity [25].\n",
      "We then calculated cross-validation consistency (CVC), which represents how many times the same two-way interaction is selected out of 10 cross-validation sets.\n",
      "Finally, we performed a screening step for every pair of interactions achieved from GMDR analysis that satisfied the two criteria, CVC ≥ 9 and test BA ≥ 0.5.\n",
      "Finally, we found 524 two-way interactions under these screening criteria.\n",
      "Among these interactions, 127 are from genes that are known to be associated with obesity and are summarized in Table 2.\n",
      "Among these interactions, five genes-FTO, CBARA1, CHUK, SLIT3, and NRXN3-and 59 SNPs have been reported in previous studies [15, 16, 26-29].\n",
      "Visualization of these 524 two-way interactions into a network graph was then made after annotating SNPs to the genes.\n",
      "We used Gephi (https://gephi.org) as a visualization tool.\n",
      "Gene annotation was performed according to the hg18 human genome reference and dbSNP 129.\n",
      "These 524 twoway interactions are displayed in the network graph (Fig.1).\n",
      "Each node represents either an SNP or gene.\n",
      "If a SNP is annotated to a known gene, then it is denoted by the gene name.\n",
      "The number of interactions between nodes was represented as the thickness of the edge.\n",
      "For example, node FTO has a very thick edge with node NT5C2.\n",
      "Conversely, some nodes have a large number of nodes that are connected with it.\n",
      "We call these nodes hub nodes or hub SNPs.\n",
      "Hub nodes are represented by a gray background color.\n",
      "We investigated which SNPs that were included in the 524 two-way interactions are related with obesity using DAVID [30], a comprehensive set of functional annotation tools.\n",
      "As a result, we detected six genes-NDUFA8, NDUFB8, NDUFC2, NDUFS2, COX5A, and ATP6V1B2.\n",
      "The role of these genes in the metabolism pathway is related to oxidative phosphorylation, which plays an important role of hepatic mitochondrial function in the development of obesity [31].\n",
      "Among the 524 two-way interactions, some SNPs might have weak main effects but have strong interactions with other SNPs.\n",
      "Table 3 shows the SNPs from hub genes that show significant two-way interactions with other SNPs but have weak marginal effects in the single SNP analysis.\n",
      "For the network graph analysis, four public databases (HuGENet [21], COXPRESdb [24], miRBase [22], and isrSNP [23]) were collected and used to investigate the biological relationship between two SNPs with an interaction.\n",
      "A short summary of each database is given in Table 4.\n",
      "All databases used in this study were converted from the original bulk to a database table with automated script for the integrated investigation.\n",
      "The script for this conversion can be provided upon request.\n",
      "In order to improve the biological relevance of the interpretation, we excluded all interactions having linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two SNPs.\n",
      "One of the results of the network graph analysis is given in Fig.2.\n",
      "We identified at least one line of biological evidence among 26% of the 524 GxG interactions.\n",
      "In order to investigate the relationship between CVC and the rate of biological evidence, we performed an additional network analysis using 1,838 interactions (CVC ≥ 7) and found out that there was a strong relationship between CVC of the GMDR analysis and the presence of known biological evidence.\n",
      "As shown in Table 5, the proportion of interactions having a known biological interaction was significantly higher when CVC = 10 than when 7 ≤ CVC < 10 (39% vs. 17% on average).\n",
      "In addition, from the network analysis of 179 interactions having CVC = 10, 69 interactions showed biological evidence and 30 (43% of 69) shared a known relationship against BMI-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, body weight, hypertension.\n",
      "The main purpose of a GWAS is to detect genetic variants represented by a single SNP or a set of SNPs that are associated with common complex polygenic traits of interest [2, 4, 5, 16, 17].\n",
      "However, it is commonly known that multiple genetic factors as well as several environmental factors and their interactions are involved in causing complex diseases.\n",
      "Thus, the single SNP approach is not appropriate for detecting multiple genetic factors for common complex polygenic traits.\n",
      "Recently, many researchers have tried GxG interaction analysis in GWASs.\n",
      "However, they focused on rather restricted regions with a small number of SNPs due to computational complexity [32, 33].\n",
      "In this paper, we have successfully performed two-way GxG interaction analysis of 8,838 individuals with the selected 101,837 SNPs, which cover most genomic regions.\n",
      "It became possible with the help of a GPU-based system with three GPU graphic cards.\n",
      "It took only 19 h to perform 51,853,363,660 possible two-way interaction analyses with 10-fold cross-validation.\n",
      "Our results showed that the FTO, CBARA1, CHUK, SLIT3, and NRXN3 genes are strongly associated with obesity.\n",
      "In addition, our approach provided more information about possible GxG interactions.\n",
      "Note that some SNPs having weak main effects showed strong interactions with other SNPs (Table 3).\n",
      "It would have been very difficult to detect these SNPs through single SNP analysis, which demonstrates the usefulness of our approach in detecting GxG interactions.\n",
      "In addition, our analysis provided some novel interactions that have not been reported in previous studies.\n",
      "For example, 9 SNPs from the FTO gene were found to have interactions with SNPs from CNNM2, AS3MT, and NT5C2.\n",
      "Similar interactions were found between LOC301738 and PDZRN4, as shown in Fig.1.\n",
      "Our network graph summarizes two-way interactions between SNPs very efficiently.\n",
      "We expect that this visualization tool could be helpful to researchers.\n",
      "It is also quite efficient to identify specific patterns and hub genes.\n",
      "Through our network graph analysis, we also identified several pieces of evidence that supported the identified interactions with known biological information.\n",
      "From the investigation with four published databases, we found that 39% of a total of 179 interactions with CVC = 10 are known to have biological interactions from the four databases we collected.\n",
      "In addition, our network graph analysis showed a higher identification rate of shared biological relevance when the CVC was large than when the CVC was low, which suggests that interactions having a high value of CVC tend to share more known biological evidence that are actually related the phenotype.\n",
      "In summary, our network graph analysis from GxG interaction analysis successfully identified the relationship between interactions from GMDR analysis and actual biological relevance.\n",
      "In addition, our strategy interpreted GxG interactions very effectively in finding known biological evidence using multiple public databases, especially in finding evidence that is actually related with the phenotype.\n",

      "One hopes that studies of grammar serve as an appropriate tool for theory formation.\n",
      "Thus, we have developed JSequitur for automatically generating the grammatical structure of biological sequences in an inference framework of string compression algorithms.\n",
      "Our original motivation was to find any grammatical traits of several cancer genes that can be detected by string compression algorithms.\n",
      "Through this research, we could not find any meaningful unique traits of the cancer genes yet, but we could observe some interesting traits in regards to the relationship among gene length, similarity of sequences, the patterns of the generated grammar, and compression rate.\n",
      "In formal language theory a language is simply a set of strings of characters drawn from some alphabet, where the alphabet (terminal) is a set of symbols.\n",
      "When we consider biological sequences simply as a language in the context of formal language theory (treating DNA, RNA, or protein sequences just as strings of alphabets of four nucleotides or 20 amino acids), a grammatical inference method based on formal language theory can be applied [1-3].\n",
      "Nevill-Manning and Witten [4] pioneered the attempt to produce the context-free grammarof biological sequences in an automatic way.\n",
      "This task can be formalized as the problem of finding the smallest context-free grammar by recursively replacing the repeats by a new symbol.\n",
      "The algorithm builds a hierarchy of phrases by forming a new rule out of existing pairs of symbols, including non-terminal symbols.\n",
      "Title: For example, if we consider the string \"atattattatt,\" the simplest way to represent the string by context-free grammar is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: <Grammar 0>\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: S → atattattatt\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: The most frequently occurring sequence in the string is \"at,\" which occurs four times.\n",

      "\n",
      "where the grammar consists of a start symbol (i.e., S), two terminal symbols (i.e., a, t) represented by lowercase letters, two non-terminal symbols (i.e., S, A) represented by uppercase letters, and two production rules (i.e., S → AAtAtAt, A → at) with a left- and a right-hand side consisting of a sequence of these symbols.\n",
      "Title: Repeatedly replacing the frequently occurring patterns \"At,\" again to a new nonterminal symbol, B, gives the following modified grammar:\n",

      "By applying the three production rules by replacing an occurrence of the nonterminals on the left-hand side of the production rule with those that appear on the right-hand side, the string \"atattattatt\" can be derived from the non-terminal S by constantly applying a series of derivations: S → ABBB → atBBB → atAtBB → atattBB → atattAtB → atattattB → atattattAt → atattattatt.\n",
      "Based on this concept, grammar-based compression algorithms have shown some success for various applications [4-7].\n",
      "Especially, grammar can capture distant repetitions occurring far apart, which was a limitation of sliding window approaches.\n",
      "However, grammar-based compression algorithms at this moment do not show the best performance for compression itself [6].\n",
      "Thus, our motivation of this study is not to develop a new algorithm or find the most efficient way to compress biological sequences for storage purposes.\n",
      "Our sole purpose of developing a new tool is to investigate any grammatical traits of biological sequences, based on formal language theory.\n",
      "We have developed a slightly modified version of Sequitur [4] called JSequitur for automatically creating hierarchical structures of sequences [8], as in Fig.1.\n",
      "Our main contribution is to improve Sequitur to work better in a graphic user interface (GUI) environment, as our main interest was in studying the generated grammar, rather than enhancing the compression rate itself.\n",
      "JSequitur is implemented in Java and organized into six classes, as in Fig.2: Sequitur, Symbol, Guard, Terminal, Nonterminal, and Rule.\n",

      "For example, compression rate can also be influenced by the algorithm itself, depending on whether we replace the longest pattern first or the most frequently occurring pattern first.\n",
      "We also compared some mouse genes to find any homologous traits in regards to compression rate and hierarchical structure of the grammar.\n",
      "For example, we compared human MUC1 (Homo sapiens, 5,279 bp) with mouse MUC1 (Mus musculus, 5,614 bp), and the compression rates for these two sequences were 0.180 and 0.195, respectively.\n",

      "However, it is extremely difficult to select keywords to capture bioinformatics patents, reflecting the convergence of several underlying technologies.\n",
      "No single word or even several words are sufficient to identify such patents.\n",
      "The analysis of patent subclasses can provide valuable information.\n",
      "In this paper, I did a preliminary study of the current status of bioinformatics patents and their International Patent Classification (IPC) groups registered in the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) database.\n",
      "There are many ways that research gaps between science and technology can be identified.\n",
      "Bibliographic citation of both academic literature and patent documents is one of the solutions.\n",
      "Unfortunately, patent documents are considerably less accessible [1], compared to academic papers.\n",
      "Whereas vast amount of new information is made available to the public through patents, only a small set of patents are cited in academic papers [2].\n",
      "Thus, the essential problem arising from citing patents related to bioinformatics is to devise a classification methodology that identifies the relevant patent and only those patents.\n",
      "The suitability of the methodology depends on the purpose of the analysis.\n",
      "However, no single methodology is ideal for identifying patents for a convergence technology, such as bioinformatics.\n",
      "By its nature, it is at the intersection of a number of patent classes.\n",
      "Accordingly, this paper tentatively employs several methodologies simultaneously to analyze the current status of bioinformatics and to find relevant subclasses, using the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS, http://www.kipris.or.kr/) patent search system.\n",
      "Initially, a multiple-word search is undertaken of these patents' titles and abstracts.\n",
      "The selected lists are then tabulated, based on International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses together with some known bioinformatics subclasses.\n",
      "These were then reviewed manually to establish a revised list of bioinformatics patents.\n",

      "\n",
      "(DNA + RNA + protein + genome) * AB = [algorithm + database + visualization], would retrieve 468 registered patents from the KIPRIS database, as in Fig.1.\n",
      "The number of patents can be further reduced by manual screening.\n",
      "Likewise, a common methodology is to undertake keyword searches of the patent title, abstract, or claim, as it is not practical to review the complete claims, specifications, and drawings of related patents.\n",
      "However, this approach of a pure keyword search has the inherent problem of both including irrelevant patents along with bioinformatics patents and of potentially missing relevant bioinformatics patents.\n",
      "For example, the number of patent documents that have the keyword 'bioinformatics' in the KIPRIS database is 446, as of November 18, 2012.\n",
      "However, the majority of them can not be classified as bioinformatics patents.\n",
      "On the other hand, there is no warranty that actual bioinformatics patents would at least have the keyword 'bioinformatics' in their documents.\n",
      "Nonetheless, this approach illustrates the converging nature of the technologies comprising bioinformatics and represents a good starting point for examining the cross-classification of bioinformatics patents.\n",
      "An alternative approach to expand a patent search beyond pure keywords is to include classification information and to use a definition of bioinformatics patents based on several patent subclasses in which bioinformatics patents are expected to be clustered.\n",
      "A good starting point to choose relevant IPC (http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/) bioinformatics classes would be to reference preselected bioinformatics classes.\n",
      "For example, the US Patent Classification (USPC) bioinformatics patent subclasses (382/125, 702/19, 702/20, 702/21, 703/11, and 703/12) suggested in [3, 4] could be used, and they have been mapped into IPC groups G06K 9/00, G01N 33/48, G01N 33/50, G01N 31/00, and G06G 7/58, as in Table 1, by using the USPC-to-IPC reverse concordance system (http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/classification/index.jsp).\n",
      "Then, queries using various keywords combined with the groups in Table 1 were initially performed, using the Patent Information Analysis System (PIAS, http://www.kipris.or.kr/kor/add_service/service/service_pias_1.jsp) system, as in Fig.2.\n",
      "New subclasses or groups linked to bioinformatics can be identified by using various combinations of query terms, as is listed in the left window of Fig.2.\n",

      "CD8+ T cells are key factors involved in the chronicity of CLD.\n",

      "The presence of the rs2808426 SNP in the promoter region of IFI6 led us to screen for transcription factors with binding sites near or on rs2808426 (C > T).\n",
      "The binding of several transcription factors, including isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor α, STAT4, v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1), and ETS2, to the protective allele (C) was predicted by ALLGEN PROMO (version 3.0.2; http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3) [27].\n",
      "Interestingly, the binding of ETS1 to the region containing rs2808426 T was not predicted.\n",
      "Differential binding of ETS1 according to the genotype of rs2808426 may affect the expression of IFI6.\n",
      "IFI6 expression by type I IFNs triggers the formation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complexes containing activated STAT1/STAT2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 and their translocation into the nucleus, where they bind to the tandem IFN-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) in the promoter of IFI6 [21, 28-31].\n",
      "Tandem binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE is required for maximum expression of IFI6 [32], and the promoter region, including rs2808426, enhances IFI6 expression more than the ISRE region alone [21].\n",
      "The ISGF3-binding site for the ISRE is separated from the ETS1-binding site by about 1.35 kb.\n",
      "The transcription factor ETS1 may regulate the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by protein-protein interaction with STAT1, which is a component of ISGF3 [33].\n",
      "Overexpression of ETS1 in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line enhances the expression of IFI6 up to 18.4-fold [34].\n",

      "In the first stage of the analysis, significant associations between the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphism genotypes and diplotypes were detected.\n",
      "A risk that was associated with the TT genotype in rs2808426 and rs10902662 was detected in the comparison between the SR and the CLD and HEP groups.\n",
      "Strong LD was found between the SNPs rs2808426 and rs10902662, containing most of the promoter region.\n",
      "In addition, diplotype analysis showed that the C-C HT was associated with a higher chance of SR than the T-T/T-T diplotype and that the C-C HT had a protective effect.\n",
      "The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that rs2808426 and rs10902662 may serve as candidate genetic screening markers for HBV clearance or that causative variants that are responsible for HBV clearance may be present in this LD block.\n",
      "The association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV-induced chronic disease suggest that these polymorphisms might change the expression level of IFI6 according to transcription factor binding.\n",
      "Therefore, an increase in IFI6 expression that is associated with polymorphisms of the gene could inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and block the transmission of the apoptosis signals through Bim in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells.\n",
      "HBV-specific CD8+ T cells would thus escape from antigen-induced apoptosis, proliferate, and then differentiate into activated CD8+ T cells to eliminate HBV from the host.\n",
      "The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that IFI6 polymorphisms play a significant role.\n",
      "In previous studies, CD8+ T cell-related gene polymorphisms, such as those of secreted phosphoprotein 1, interleukin-18, and cyclin D2, were reported to affect the natural course of chronic HBV infections in the Korean population, but the effect of their genetic association is minor (OR, 0.69 to 1.44) [35, 36].\n",
      "Furthermore, genomewide association studies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region polymorphisms, including HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQ, demonstrated their association with the chronicity of HBV [37-43].\n",
      "In our first-stage analysis, the protective effect of the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms was stronger than that reported previously in studies addressing the association with HBV (OR, 6.60).\n",
      "The genotype and diplotype distribution in both groups remained significant after multiple testing by Bonferroni's correction and permutation test.\n",
      "These results might support that genetic variation in IFI6 affects the clearance of HBV.\n",
      "A second set of samples was used to replicate the results of the first-stage analysis.\n",
      "However, in the second association analysis, the comparison of the SR and the HEP and CIR groups did not yield significant results, even when merging the first- and second-stage samples in a meta-analysis.\n",
      "This could have been due to variation in the sampling cohort, environmental interactions, inadequate statistical power, or gene interactions [1, 44-49].\n",
      "Furthermore, information on factors important for the progression of liver disease was lacking in the samples analyzed, such as data on alcohol consumption [50].\n",
      "Although our data could not be reproduced, the results showing an association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV chronicity are significant.\n",
      "Our study is the first study to investigate the association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV clearance as an ISG.\n",
      "In addition, SR patients were used as controls instead of normal healthy subjects to show the effect of genomic background on the chronicity of HBV infection.\n",
      "Normal controls that never contracted HBV are not suitable to show the genetic effects.\n",
      "Future studies should include a larger sample size and additional information in the replication study to validate the significance of the results through epistasis and environmental interactions.\n",
      "In addition, IFI6 promoter variations should be characterized using next-generation sequencing techniques, causal variants should be identified, and mechanisms underlying the effect of IFI6 on HBV clearance that is mediated by HBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell survival need to be investigated.\n",
      "In the present study, an initial discovery stage showed that the rs2808426 and rs10902662 genotypes and the corresponding diplotype were associated with a higher probability of HBV clearance in a Korean population.\n",
      "However, the results could not be replicated in a second stage with a different patient sample.\n",
      "Further studies should be aimed at showing how IFI6 affects HBV clearance by promoting HBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell survival.\n",
      "Moreover, identification of causal variants in the IFI6 by including a large number of samples may help clarify the role of IFI6 on HBV clearance.\n",

      "Open chromatin regions (nucleosome-depleted regions that are sensitive to cleavage by the DNase I enzyme) have been widely used to identify active DNA regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions [12, 13].\n",

      "The HSPs are classified on the basis of their approximate molecular mass (e.g., the 70-kDa species is the Hsp70 family).\n",
      "DNAJ and DNAK are members of the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families, respectively [3].\n",
      "These proteins are known to cooperate in many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, protein folding, protein export, and stress response in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner [4-6].\n",
      "The cooperation of DNAJ and DNAK is dependent on the interactions between the J domain of DNAJ and the ATPase domain of DNAK [7].\n",
      "DNAJ proteins were classified using the J, zinc finger, and carboxy-terminal domains [8].\n",
      "Type I DNAJs contain all three domains, while type II proteins have a J domain linked directly to a carboxy-terminal domain without a zinc finger domain.\n",
      "The type III proteins include only the J domain.\n",
      "However, such domain architectures of DNAJ were not deliberated on most eukaryotic genome annotations, which might cause overestimation of DNAJ entries [9, 10].\n",
      "Likewise, many studies of DNAKs have been used without any unified nomenclature or notation [11, 12], although ATPase and peptide-binding domains had been defined [13].\n",

      "The DNAK family was clustered by sequence similarity (BLAST E-value cutoff e-5) using the Tribe Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm [17], because no class has been made in this family.\n",
      "Finally, 12,908 DNAJs and 4,886 DNAKs were identified and deposited into EDD.\n",
      "In the DNAJ family, 895, 3,172, and 8,700 proteins were classified as type I, II, and III, respectively.\n",
      "Twenty-one clusters were determined in DNAK, and 4,853 proteins (99.1%) belonged to the first four clusters.\n",
      "Title: Web-based interfaces of the EDD\n",

      "Secondly, the EDD allows users to browse the detailed information on DNAJ/Ks and to analyze it via 'favorite'.\n",
      "It is a customized cyber-workbench where users can create folders, store favored items, and perform 10 bioinformatics analyses, such as BLAST search, BLASTMatrix, ClustalW, DNAJ/K statistics, a DNAJ class viewer, a DNAJ/K domain viewer, and a glycine ratio viewer.\n",
      "Especially, 'favorite', implemented in the EDD, is specialized for the functional analysis of DNAJ/K proteins (e.g., DNAJ/K domain view).\n",
      "The data saved in 'favorite' can be shared with CFGP 2.0 for further comparative analysis [16].\n",
      "Finally, a highlighted function of the EDD is a 'taxonomy' browser powered by the 'Species-driven User Interface', which provides an interactive interface for displaying the taxonomical hierarchy for DNAJ/Ks.\n",
      "Users can drag and drop any taxon or taxa and perform sequence download, statistics, class and cluster analyses, ClustalW alignment, and BLAST search.\n",
      "The comprehensive information on DNAJ/Ks conserved in 339 genomes over seven phyla is a useful resource for molecular chaperone studies in eukaryotes.\n",

      "Growing numbers of studies employ cell line-based systematic short interfering RNA (siRNA) screens to study gene functions and to identify drug targets.\n",
      "As multiple sources of variations that are unique to siRNA screens exist, there is a growing demand for a computational tool that generates normalized values and standardized scores.\n",
      "However, only a few tools have been available so far with limited usability.\n",
      "Here, we present siMacro, a fast and easy-to-use Microsoft Office Excel-based tool with a graphic user interface, designed to process single-condition or two-condition synthetic screen datasets.\n",
      "siMacro normalizes position and batch effects, censors outlier samples, and calculates Z-scores and robust Z-scores, with a spreadsheet output of >120,000 samples in under 1 minute.\n",
      "Human tissue-derived cell lines have served as an effective platform for understanding the molecular biology of diseases and increasingly for drug discovery [1, 2].\n",
      "For wholesale analysis of gene sets or chemical compound files, cell line-based high-throughput screening is typically performed on a well-to-well basis in high-density microtiter plates.\n",
      "From this, significant changes in cellular phenotype by each perturbation in a given library compared to mock controls or other samples are identified.\n",
      "Examples of perturbations include synthetic small molecules, natural products, cDNA expression libraries, and, of primary focus here, genomewide collections of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs).\n",
      "It is a truism that cell-based screens are highly vulnerable to environmental variations.\n",
      "In particular, siRNA screens involve multiple processing steps employing automatic or semiautomatic liquid-handling equipment carried out over many days.\n",
      "Each step introduces position-specific variables and distinct operational failures.\n",
      "This, combined with unavoidable batch effects from cell cultures and reagent efficacy, can introduce asymmetric phenotypic variation that is independent of the perturbations of interest.\n",
      "Accounting for and correcting this variation is well recognized as an essential component of successful high-throughput screening.\n",
      "Statistical methods to process whole-genome siRNA screen data have been reported by others [3, 4], but limited open-source tools are currently available [3, 5, 6].\n",
      "Moreover, as most available open-source tools are written in R/bioconductor [3, 6], modifications that require screen-specific command lines are challenging without prior experience in script programming.\n",
      "Very recently, a web-based tool (web cellHTS2) and its standalone package [5] have been published.\n",
      "However, they either run on a remote server or require other specialized preinstalled software.\n",
      "Here, we present siMacro, a GUI-based simple tool for processing cell-based high-throughput screening datasets.\n",
      "siMacro has been implemented in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and packaged as a Microsoft Office Excel add-in.\n",
      "It allows one-step, fast, and easy suppression of outlier values; normalization; and standardization of a complete raw dataset from a genomewide siRNA screen in an intuitive spreadsheet format.\n",
      "The tool processes the data points associated with a 2-condition genomewide screen with biological triplicates on a standard laptop computer in less than 1 minute.\n",
      "Title: Prerequisite\n",
      "\n",
      "We assume the screen was done in 96- or 384-well plates and passed the standard quality control metric (by Z or Z' factor, for example).\n",
      "siMacro is robust against sporadic bad wells from triplicate experiments but will not censor an entire plate compromised by massive failure, such as broad contamination.\n",
      "We also assume siRNAs in the library plate are randomly distributed, which is generally true for most commercially available genomewide siRNA libraries.\n",
      "siMacro currently supports 1- or 2-condition screens.\n",
      "Title: Input data\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: siMacro requires all the individual plate readouts be put into an Excel spreadsheet with the field headers: day or cell batch, plate name, well name, and raw data columns per siRNA or a pool (Fig.1C).\n",
      "siMacro allows only numerical data field values except for manually censored \"bad\" wells masked by 'NA.'\n",
      "Title: Normalization\n",
      "\n",
      "Most popular normalization protocols employ either on-plate control-based or sample-based methods.\n",
      "Although there is no golden rule for this, we prefer the latter for most siRNA screens, as 1) cell-based siRNA screening is vulnerable to within-plate variation, such as an edge effect and column/row effects that are not corrected by on-board controls [4], and 2) because siRNA hits are often rare within a given test plate, the majority of samples proxies the mock control.\n",
      "Therefore, siMacro currently only supports normalization by samples at the resolution of a plate, row, and column.\n",
      "Depending on the cellular phenotype and experimental design, the optimal choice of resolution varies and can therefore be specified by the screener.\n",
      "If row or column effects are trivial or there are more than 10-30 hits per 96-well plate, a user can choose plate median normalization (default).\n",
      "As many liquid dispensers move row-wise, a row effect is very common in the siRNA screens.\n",
      "If the hits/plate is less than 10 per 96-well plate and accompanied by a significant row effect, row-median normalization is a better choice.\n",
      "Title: Censoring bad wells\n",
      "\n",
      "Sporadic bad wells are often manually censored one by one, which is inefficient and error-prone in large-scale screens.\n",
      "If the experiment is done in triplicate or more, bad wells can be detected automatically by the inflated coefficient of variation (CV) among the replicates.\n",
      "siMacro identifies bad wells by applying a user-defined cutoff to the CV among normalized values from a replicate.\n",
      "The default is 1%, meaning 1% of the total genes with the highest CV will have a masked outlier well.\n",
      "This significantly reduces false positives but can also overcorrect.\n",
      "Therefore, siMacro reports flags for all genes with censored wells to aid user decisions with regard to exclusion from downstream analysis.\n",
      "Title: Standardization and hit scoring\n",
      "\n",
      "A unified scoring scheme is employed that accounts for batch effects from multiday experiments.\n",
      "Under the assumption of normality, the Z-score, which indicates how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean, is an intuitive scoring metric.\n",
      "However, it is sensitive to biological outliers (hits) in the data pool, resulting in deflated scores.\n",
      "An alternative is to use the robust Z-score, which is a measure of the median absolute deviation from the median.\n",
      "siMacro calculates the Z-score and the robust Z-score from the user-provided unit of experiment: e.g., the day, cell batch, or plate.\n",
      "siMacro takes the mean of log2-transformed normalized values from replicates for the calculation.\n",
      "For a 2-condition synthetic phenotype screen, the log2 ratio between the 2 conditions is used per siRNA to calculate the Z and the robust Z-scores for a synthetic effect.\n",
      "siMacro returns output, including individual and mean normalized values, Z-score, robust Z-score, and flags, for the censored bad wells directly onto the Excel data sheet as additional columns (Fig.1D).\n",
      "The original source written in R is implemented in VBA and packaged as an Excel add-in.\n",
      "Since ease of use is the main objective of the plug-in, it provides simple GUI and depends only on Excel.\n",
      "As Excel is widely utilized and familiar to most biologists, siMacro provides an immediate option for dataset processing together with Excel-based data visualization tools.\n",
      "siMacro runs on Microsoft Office Excel 2007 or later for the Windows OS or Excel 2011 for the Mac OS.\n",
      "On a standard laptop computer with a Pentium dual-core 1.73 GHz processor and 1 GB memory, the operating time is under 60 seconds to process a triplicate 2-condition genomewide data set.\n",
      "As a test set, the direct lethality dataset from 21,125 sets of siRNA oligos in a non-small cell lung cancer line, H1155 [7], was used.\n",

      "IHEC was born with ground making effort of these several international consortiums.\n",
      "Although the Human Genome Project, which defined the exact sequence of 3 billion bases in DNA, is one of the big milestones in genome research, cataloging DNA sequence information has a limited effect on defining whole varieties of genome variations that are expected to be crucial cause of disease.\n",
      "Also, the sequence itself does not provide how the genome is packaged in chromosomes and chromatin, which is essential for organismal development and differentiation.\n",
      "So, epigenetic regulation, in addition to transcription factor binding profile, is emerging as a powerful tool to identify disease correlation with genome information [1].\n",
      "In 2004, a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored workshop, Epigenetic Mechanisms in Cancer, had initiating discussions of necessity of the Human Epigenome Project, which will be in parallel with the Human Genome Project.\n",
      "In 2005, there was a special workshop on the BLUEPRINT for a Human Epigenome Project, the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Human Epigenome Workshop, on defining human epigenomes at high resolution.\n",
      "The consensus of workshop participants was that there were compelling reasons from both scientific and public health perspectives to initiate a human epigenome project that could take full advantage of advances in several existing US and European initiatives.\n",
      "In 2006, TCGA began as a 3-year pilot with an investment of $50 million each from the NCI and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to analyze the genome and epigenome of 20 types of cancer tissue.\n",
      "In 2008, amending the TCGA, international efforts were assembled to analyze cancer genome/epigenome variation.\n",
      "As a result, the ICGC was launched in 2008 to coordinate large-scale cancer (epi)genome studies in tumors from 50 cancer types and/or subtypes, with participation of 15 countries.\n",
      "ICGC is focused on obtaining a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic changes in 50 different tumor types.\n",
      "Also, the international Alliance for Human Epigenetics and Disease (AHEAD) [2] was conceived among participating countries.\n",
      "As a result, the Roadmap Epigenomics Program was fostered as AHEAD's suggestion.\n",
      "Finally the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Program was initiated with the funding of $200 million for 5 years from NIH [3].\n",
      "Roadmap Epigenomics aimed to produce reference epigenome data from a variety of human cells.\n",
      "As NIH and European epigenome mapping activity was commenced as a locally scattered project, there were efforts to assemble reference epigenome mapping as an international collaboration.\n",

      "The 1,000 epigenome includes 250 types of human cells, and 10% of the epigenome can be mapped on a model organism.\n",
      "A long-term objective of IHEC is to determine the extent to which the epigenome has shaped human populations over generations and in response to the environment and to produce human reference epigenome maps for key cellular status relevant to health and disease.\n",
      "IHEC will focus on key cellular status, such as stemness, immortality, proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and stress, thereby generating new knowledge that will catalyze progress in health research and regenerative medicine.\n",
      "IHEC will coordinate rapid distribution of the data to the entire research community with minimal restrictions to accelerate translation of this new knowledge into health and diseases.\n",
      "IHEC also will coordinate the development of common bioinformatics standards, data models, and analytical tools to organize, integrate, and display whole epigenomic data generated from this important international effort.\n",
      "IHEC will set up an efficient structure that will coordinate this international effort so that the interest and priorities of individual participants, self-organizing consortia, funding agencies, and nations are addressed.\n",
      "IHEC will encourage the minimal amount of redundancy between the different epigenetics efforts around the world.\n",
      "IHEC will also interact and coordinate its efforts with other international projects, such as ICGC and ENCODE.\n",
      "The secondary goal of IHEC is to catalyze the development of new and robust technologies that will facilitate the characterization and functional analysis of the epigenome in health and diseases, thereby driving down the costs of epigenome mapping substantially, and to support the dissemination of knowledge and standards related to new technologies, software, and methods to facilitate data integration and sharing between epigenetics researchers around the globe.\n",
      "By the production of 1,000 epigenomes, IHEC expects that we can understand the key cellular aspects of 250 types of human cells more deeply.\n",
      "Also, having ~250 types of reference epigenomes, we can have the power to compare disease epigenomes to normal references, which will help explain the missing heritability of common complex diseases.\n",

      "Moreover, overlapping target tissues among member institutions is a limitation.\n",
      "Cell types, such as blood and adipocyte, that easy to get seem to be popular targets in every IHEC member and should be coordinated in a central way to foster synergy from each mapping activity.\n",

      "Expressed lncRNAs have an activating histone modification profile similar to that of protein-coding genes, with slightly excess levels of both silencing (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K36me3) marks in lncRNAs [24].\n",
      "Although many lncRNAs are polyadenylated, they are significantly enriched in nonpolyadenylated transcripts compared with coding RNAs [24].\n",
      "As expected, the lncRNAs have significantly lower protein potentials compared with mRNAs.\n",
      "Interestingly, they are biased toward two-exon transcripts and predominately localized in the chromatin and nucleus, while coding RNAs are predominantly observed in the cytosol; only 6% of them have a 2-exon structure.\n",
      "In order to identify the function and targets of lncRNAs, Derrien et al.\n",
      "[24] investigated the correlation between lncRNAs and coding RNAs; both positive and negative correlations were found.\n",
      "Overall, the number of positive correlations was larger than the negative correlations.\n",
      "Compared with trans-acting lncRNAs, cis-acting lncRNAs showed more positive correlations.\n",
      "Interestingly, lncRNAs that intersected protein-coding exons in the antisense orientation showed a strong pattern of coexpression [24].\n",
      "They also checked sequence conservation by BLASTing human lncRNAs against all available mammalian genomes.\n",
      "Around 30% (n = 4,546) of lncRNAs appeared to have arisen in the primate lineage, and 0.7% (n = 101) of them appeared to be human-specific [24].\n",
      "Title: RNA splicing\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies suggest that many pre-mRNA processing events are cotranscriptional [25-27].\n",
      "RNA imaging found that splicing can follow the completion of transcription [28].\n",
      "Tilgner et al.\n",
      "[29] investigated cotranscriptional splicing by interrogating RNA fractions from several cellular compartments in K562 cells.\n",
      "They found that only a tiny fraction of exons were found to be surrounded completely by an unspliced intron in chromatin-associated RNA.\n",
      "This suggests that splicing is already occurring during transcription [18, 29].\n",
      "The strong enrichment of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the chromatin-associated fraction compared with other fractions also supports cotranscriptional splicing.\n",
      "These observations confirm the idea that chromatin structure could play a role in splicing [7, 30-34].\n",
      "However, for alternative exons and lncRNAs, splicing tends to occur later and might remain unspliced in some cases [29].\n",
      "Title: RNA editing\n",
      "\n",
      "Li et al.\n",
      "[35] reported 10,210 exonic sites in the human genome where an RNA sequence did not match with the DNA sequence, suggestive of RNA editing.\n",
      "However, there have been debates about whether their observations occurred by sequencing error, gene duplication, mapping error, or read-end misalignment [36-38].\n",
      "Park et al.\n",
      "[39] developed a pipeline to filter sequencing artifacts in identifying RNA editing.\n",
      "They found that the majority of non-A-to-G variants came from incorrect read mapping across splice junctions.\n",
      "Most of the edits they found were A-to-G(I) variants, which corresponds with recent observations [40] but differs from Li et al.\n",
      "'s report [35] of a substantial number of noncanonical single nucleotide variant edits in the RNA of human lymphoblastoid cells.\n",
      "Most A-to-G(I) edits were located in introns and untranslated regions, with only a fraction of sites reproducibly edited across multiple cell lines.\n",
      "Title: Pseudogenes\n",
      "\n",
      "Pseudogenes have been considered nonfunctional sequences of genomic DNA that lost their coding potential due to disruptive mutations, such as frameshifts and premature stop codons [41-44].\n",
      "Recent studies have shown that pseudogenes can regulate their parent genes [45-49].\n",
      "Using manual annotation, with the assistance of computational pipelines, GENCODE created a database called Pseudogene Decoration Resource (psiDR).\n",
      "psiDR provides a variety of information on 11,216 peudogenes, including transcription activity, chromatin features, functional genomics, and evolutionary constraints [50].\n",
      "Transcribed pseudogenes show enhanced chromatin accessibility and enrichment with histone marks, although they are lower than those of coding genes.\n",
      "The majority of pseudogenes contains no or very few transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), but the differences between the number of TFBSs associated with transcribed and nontranscribed pseudogenes are significant.\n",
      "Title: Small RNAs\n",
      "\n",
      "GENCODE also categorized 7,054 small RNAs into 2,756 micro RNAs (miRNAs), snRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and transfer RNAs (tRNAs).\n",
      "They found that miRNAs and tRNAs were abundant in cytosol, snoRNAs were in the nucleus, and snRNAs were in both the nucleus and cytosol.\n",
      "snRNAs were found abundantly in the chromatin-associated RNA fractions, which further supports predominant splicing during transcription.\n",
      "Title: Enhancer RNAs\n",
      "\n",
      "RNAs at enhancers (eRNAs) were first characterized by observing transcription activities at the promoter-distal CREB binding protein-binding sites in mouse cortical neurons [51].\n",
      "The bidirectional property of eRNAs and their association with gene expression were further studied using nascent RNAs from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data [52, 53].\n",
      "ENCODE used RNA assays to detect transcription activity.\n",
      "Besides the bidirectional property, ENCODE identified transcriptional initiation using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) [54] signals.\n",
      "Interestingly, they found polyadenylated eRNAs, although most eRNAs were prevalent in the nonpolyadenylated form.\n",
      "They also observed that histone marks associated with eRNAs were the factors for transcriptional initiation and elongation: H3K27ac, H3K79me2, and RNA polymerase.\n",
      "These lines of evidence suggest regulatory functions of eRNAs.\n",
      "Enabled by the unprecedented volume of data generated by the ENCODE project, Dong et al.\n",
      "[57] performed a very interesting study that attempted to predict gene expression from chromatin features using machine learning techniques.\n",
      "As usually practiced, a machine learning study is composed of a series of procedures that typically involve data collection, data representation, model building, and testing.\n",
      "Using machine learning terminology, the response variables here are gene expression patterns that are predicted/modeled, while the predictors or features are various chromatin measures.\n",
      "Chromatin data were collected from the ENCODE project with 11 chromatin modifications, one histone variant, and DNase I hypersensitivity, all mapped in seven cell lines (Table 3).\n",
      "Gene expression data were from different cellular compartments, using two different RNA isolation approaches and sequenced with different technologies (Table 3).\n",
      "With such diversity of RNA sources, Dong et al.\n",
      "[57] answered not only the general question of whether gene expression can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy but also the questions of whether different RNA sources that are sequenced by different technologies can be predicted differently using the same chromatin features.\n",
      "The gene expression data are relatively easy to represent.\n",
      "They were separated into two classes: transcriptional start site (TSS)-based and transcript-based (Tx-based).\n",
      "TSS-based expression data are read counts within a 101-bp window centered on the TSS, which measures transcriptional initiation.\n",
      "Tx-based expression data are summarized read counts from the whole transcript, which measures transcriptional elongation.\n",
      "However, the representation of chromatin data seems to be tricky and requires further research.\n",
      "Dong et al.\n",
      "[57] used a strategy called \"bestbin,\" which considers the chromatin signals across the entire gene body, including 2-kb flanking regions.\n",
      "It basically segregates each genic region into equal bins of 100 bp and summarizes the chromatin signals within each.\n",
      "A training dataset was used to identify the bin that correlates most with gene expression, and the learned parameter values were applied to testing data.\n",
      "Other strategies [58, 59] are possible, but the \"bestbin\" strategy was found to be superior [57].\n",
      "RNA sequencing data are known to contain very little or no background noise, with a large portion of the genes having 0 read counts.\n",
      "Therefore, the response variables become a mixture of a 0 component and a positive counting component.\n",
      "Neither a classifier nor regression method seems to be able to capture the variability of both.\n",
      "To deal with the challenge, a two-step approach was used by [57], so that a classifier first categorized genes as \"expressed\" or \"unexpressed,\" Then, a regression method was used to predict the expression levels of the expressed genes.\n",
      "The final prediction is the product of the classifier and the regression method.\n",
      "To test the performance of their approach, each dataset was separated into a training set and a testing set.\n",
      "On the training set, the \"best bin\" and a few other parameters were determined.\n",
      "After that, a 10-fold crossvalidation was performed on the testing set to evaluate the model.\n",
      "AUC [60] was used to represent the accuracy of the classifier.\n",
      "Two criteria were used to represent the accuracy of the regression method.\n",
      "Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to measure the similarity between the predicted value and experimental value.\n",
      "Root mean square error was used to measure the disparity between the predicted value and experimental value.\n",
      "Overall, the two-step model achieved very satisfactory performance, with a PCC > 0.9 for a number of datasets and a PCC > 0.8 for 71% of the whole data.\n",
      "Looking at the two steps separately, the AUC can be as high as 0.95 for the classifier, and the PCC can be as high as 0.77 for the regression method when predicting CAGE-measured polyA+ cytosolic RNA expression in K562 cells.\n",
      "Similar performance was achieved in other datasets.\n",
      "It was also found that H3K9ac and H3K4me3 are the most important predictors for the classifier, strengthening their roles as activation marks at TSSs.\n",
      "In contrast, H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 are the most important predictors for the regression methods, strengthening their roles as elongation marks at gene bodies.\n",
      "These findings show that the two-step model not only improved the accuracy of prediction but also enabled the identification of the chromatin features that are associated with different transcriptional roles.\n",
      "During the past decade, the ENCODE project has evolved into a genomewide scale, and the dataset it generated has expanded in quantity as well as in scope.\n",
      "The ENCODE project has provided a global view about the human transcriptome and most noticeably found that the transcribed region of the human genome is more abundant than we previously thought.\n",
      "This finding significantly reduced the so-called intergenic regions, as defined in the traditional sense.\n",
      "The quantitative measurement of RNA species in several cellular compartments as well as their polyadenylation provided a comprehensive view of RNA generation.\n",
      "In this review, we have revisited the characteristics of both coding and noncoding transcripts in association with their structures and locations in cells.\n",
      "Besides the human transcriptome and the associated chromatin modification data that we discussed, the ENCODE consortium also mapped transcription factor binding sites and their associated DNA motifs, as well as DNA methylation and long-range chromosomal interactions [4].\n",
      "In parallel, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org) and International Human Epigenome Consortium (http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org) have been accumulating data of a similar scale to understand the human genome in other tissues and conditions.\n",
      "It is remarkable that the ENCODE data altogether have associated more than 80% of the human genome with some type of biochemical function so far, and the coverage will continue to increase as we map additional protein-DNA interactions in the near future.\n",
      "It has now become very clear that so-called \"junk DNA\" is not evolutionarily vestigial but has specific structural or biochemical functions.\n",
      "While data generation has been a major goal of ENCODE, the need to integrate the current datasets is becoming more and more important.\n",
      "Computational approaches have been developed to exploit the ENCODE data at to a fuller potential.\n",
      "For instance, chromatin features were used to model gene expression [57, 61]; integrative methods were developed to annotate genomes [62-64]; visualization tools were developed to investigate epigenomic regulation at a global scale (also see ngs.plot at https://code.google.com/p/ngsplot/) [65, 66]; and large regulatory networks were reconstructed, based on TFs and DNaseI footprinting [67, 68].\n",
      "The network-based approach as well as the chromosomal interactions [69] provided novel angles in studying gene regulation at higher levels.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) belongs to the most malignant and rapidly progressive human thyroid cancers and its prognosis is very poor.\n",
      "Also, it shows high resistance to cancer treatments, so that effective treatment for ATC has not been found to date, and virtually all patients terminate their life rapidly after diagnosis.\n",
      "Although targeted treatment of genetic alterations has emerged as an extremely promising approach to human cancers, such as BRAF in metastatic melanoma, it remains unclear that how commonly genomic alterations are influenced in ATC tumorigenesis.\n",
      "In recent years, genome wide approaches have been exploited to find genetic alterations associated with complex diseases, including cancer.\n",
      "Here, we reviewed the comprehensive genetic alterations in ATC and recent approaches in the context of identifying genomic alterations associated with ATC.\n",
      "Since surprisingly few reports have been published on the genome wide study of ATC, this review puts emphasis on the urgent needs of genomic research for the prevention and treatment of ATC.\n",
      "Thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer worldwide [1].\n",
      "Especially, in Korea, the average annual incidence rates of thyroid cancer in 2010 was 17.8% recording the highest increasing rate among all cancers (National Cancer Information Center; http://www.cancer.go.kr/).\n",
      "Thyroid carcinomas can be sub-classified according to their histological and clinical features such as cellular origins or prognosis [2].\n",
      "The most common subtype of thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid cancer (PTC; 80% to 85%) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC; 10% to 25%), which are differentiated tumors derived from follicular epithelial cells.\n",
      "Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC; 5% to 10%) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC; 2% to 3%) are also derived from follicular cells.\n",
      "Parafollicular C cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprises 2-3% of all thyroid cancers [2, 3].\n",
      "The overall survival rates for PTC (98%), FTC (92%), and MTC (80%) are high [4], and these types have a more favorable prognosis by multimodality treatment.\n",
      "However, ATC has an almost typically rapid and lethal progression, and the survival rate for ATC is only 13% [4] or 1-17% [2] with a mean survival of 6 months after diagnosis [5].\n",
      "Although ATC supposed to be a follicular-cell-derived cancer, and represents a terminal stage in the dedifferentiation of PTC or FTC [6], the molecular mechanisms underlying ATC are not clear.\n",
      "Because ATC is rare disease, it has been difficult to obtain sufficient samples to study the mechanism of the tumorigenesis associated with ATC which should have great impact to survival and treatment of patients [7].\n",
      "Here, we reviewed the recent progress of the identification of genetic and epigenetic changes in ATC, focusing especially on genomic study.\n",
      "By this effort, we may clarify the further substances of genomic research to conquer the most aggressive type of thyroid carcinomas.\n",
      "To date, a considerable number of genetic mutations have been identified that play roles in the tumorigenesis of ATC, mainly by traditional approaches (Table 1) [8-13].\n",
      "The most well-known mutation of thyroid cancer is BRAFV600E, occurring in approximately 26% of ATCs and 45% of PTCs [8, 14].\n",
      "The BRAFV600E mutant protein is produced by the point mutation of T1799A coding sequence, and as consequence the BRAF kinase shows constitutive activity [15-18].\n",
      "Its oncogenic and transforming capability has been well studies [19] and interestingly, it is strongly associated with poor prognosis of PTC, including aggressive pathological characteristics, increased recurrence rates, and failure of treatment [20, 21].\n",
      "The tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly mutated in ATC [8] but uncommon in well-differentiated PTC and FTC.\n",
      "For example, Donghi et al.\n",
      "[22] reported that p53 was mutated in approximately 71% of undifferentiated thyroid cancers (UDTC).\n",
      "Also Fagin et al.\n",
      "[23] reported 83% mutation rate of p53 in ATCs, and Quiros et al.\n",
      "[24] found 88% of p53 mutation in ATC patients using immunohistochemical analysis.\n",
      "RAS mutations were detected rarely in PTC, but more prevalently in FTC and ATC [25], as if there are relationship between RAS mutations and the aggressiveness of tumor behavior and/or poor prognosis [26, 27].\n",
      "From three members of RAS family (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS), codon 12/13 of KRAS mutation is known to be associated with poor survival for more aggressive subtype of thyroid tumors, including ATC [26].\n",
      "RAS is known as an important regulator of cell growth, differentiation and survival of thyroid cancer [28].\n",
      "In tumorigenesis, RAS may mediate multiple transduction signaling pathways such as Raf-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways [29].\n",
      "Mutations of PIK3CA are also common in ATC [8].\n",
      "PIK3CA encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K and PI3K, in turns, involves in the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulates several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, adhesion and motility.\n",
      "Especially, this pathway linked to the cell survival, angiogenesis and glucose homeostasis which are important for tumorigenesis [30].\n",
      "Garcia-Rostan et al.\n",
      "[30] showed that the missense mutations of PIK3CA are higher in ATC than in others such as well-differentiated thyroid cancer.\n",
      "Additionally, ATC patients who had mutated PIK3CA showed also Ras or BRAF alterations.\n",
      "Garcia-Rostan et al.\n",
      "[31, 32] demonstrated the significant association of mutations in β-catenin and the change of its expression with poor prognosis of ATC.\n",
      "They found that activating mutations of CTNNB1, β-catenin encoding gene, often cause the activation of WNT-β-catenin signaling.\n",
      "In general, as an ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein, β-catenin is a downstream signaling molecule in Wnt pathway, and known to have a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin.\n",
      "Interestingly, when it is upregulated, the nuclear translocation is occurred so that the transcription of various tumor-promoting genes could be triggered.\n",
      "Axin 1 is a scaffold protein and located in chromosome 16p13.3.\n",
      "It is supposed to be a tumor suppressor and play a role also in the Wnt pathway.\n",
      "Kurihara et al.\n",
      "[33] found the mutation of Axin 1 in 81.8% of 22 Japanese ATC samples.\n",
      "Together, the genetic alterations of genes in the Wnt signaling pathway are found frequently with ATC suggesting the important role of Wnt pathway for ATC tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Although the mutation prevalence is not high, mutations in the gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been recently identified in ATC [9, 34].\n",
      "The overall prevalence of mutations of IDH1 was reported as 11% in 18 ATC samples by Murugan et al.[9].\n",
      "Murugan and Xing [10] reported two novel point mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, C3592T and G3602A, with a prevalence of 25% in 8 ATC tumor samples.\n",
      "ALK, one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, is a member of insulin receptor subfamily and these transverse point mutations caused the amino acid changes L1198F and G1201E, followed by increase of tyrosine kinase activities.\n",
      "Initially, ALK was identified as an oncogeneic fusion gene NPM1-ALK in anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [35].\n",
      "Further, fusion gene EML4-ALK was found in non-small-cell lung cancer [36] and TMP3/4-ALK and RANBP2-ALK in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors [37].\n",
      "They were aberrantly activated and promoted cell proliferation and survival [38, 39].\n",
      "Although these mutations have been reported to date, it is not clear what of those are the driver mutations of ATC development or if there is any.\n",
      "Also, many other mutations and genes might be associated with ATC tumorigenesis, which may contribute a lot to the diagnosis and treatment of ATC.\n",
      "Therefore, it is a natural consequence that scientists try to adapt genomic approaches to analyze the mechanism of ATC in very recent years.\n",
      "Hemmer et al.\n",
      "[12] studied DNA copy number changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in 69 primary thyroid carcinomas including 13 ATC patients.\n",
      "From those 11 ATC cases, showed chromosomal changes (10 gains, 3 deletions, both in 2 cases).\n",
      "Regions of frequent gains were mainly located in 7p22-pter, 8q22-qter, and 9q34-qter regions in 31%, 23% and 23% of ATC cases, respectively.\n",
      "The known proto-oncogenes such as PDGR-α, myc and ABL1, and VAVZ are located, in these regions but still no functional evidences were found supporting the association of copy number changes of these regions and the aggressiveness of ATC.\n",
      "Also, Rodrigues et al.\n",
      "[40] examined 39 thyroid cancer patients including 7 ATCs.\n",
      "All cases of ATC presented chromosomal imbalances, especially, they found gains at chromosome 20p and 20q, and losses of Xp in 6 cases of ATC, and gains at 3q and 5p in 5 cases ATC.\n",
      "Some important genes included PI3K, BCL6, and SST at 3q; invasion and metastases genes (MMP9 and MMP24), a cell cycle and mitotic checkpoint gene (STK15) at 20q.\n",
      "The loss of tumor suppressor gene related 7q31 was detected.\n",
      "The chromosomal instability of ATC revealed as significantly higher than well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) or PDTC when compared the CGH-detectable abnormalities as reported by couple of studies [12, 40].\n",
      "Kitamura et al.\n",
      "[41] detected allelic losses using 21 ATC patient samples in 1q (40%), 9p (58%), 11p (33%), 11q (33%), 17p (44%), 17q (43%), 19p (36%), and 22q (38%).\n",
      "Wreesmann et al.\n",
      "[13] reported the unique gains at chromosome 3p13-14 and 11q13 (where the cyclin D1 and FOSL1 located) and losses at 5q11-31 in ATC patients.\n",
      "Liu et al.\n",
      "[11] found frequent copy number gains in many receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes containing the EGFR, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, KIT, MET, PIK3Ca, PIK3Cb, and PDK1 genes.\n",
      "Many of the genes with copy number gains are known to be proto-oncogenes so that they may be play a important role in ATC tumorigenesis by increasing the protein level followed by aberrant activation of the oncogenic pathway.\n",
      "The prevalence of copy number gains was generally higher in ATC than differentiated thyroid cancer [42], also as mentioned in other studies.\n",
      "It is supposed that the copy number variations, which could be occurred by chromosomal amplification or instability, should be important and involved to the progression and aggressiveness of ATC [43].\n",
      "Chromosomal alteration could cause the genomic rearrangements and fusion genes.\n",
      "In PTC, rearrangement causing RET/PTC fusion gene was observed often, but it rarely occur in benign follicular thyroid adenoma and follicular variant PTC [44].\n",
      "Liu et al.\n",
      "[11] reported the same RET/PTC rearrangement in 3 cases of ATC tissues, but because some ATC tissues contained PTC tissues, they were suspicious to their result.\n",
      "Therefore, if chromosomal rearrangement and fusion genes, including RET/PTC fusion, involve to the ATC progression, should be investigated further.\n",
      "Although not many investigations for genome wide expression analysis were performed, several studies examined altered expression of genes in ATC cell lines or patient samples using microarray (Table 2) [45-50].\n",
      "The upand downregulated genes in ATC identified as players in the regulation of important cellular functions which may influencing to the tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Onda et al.\n",
      "[45] found 31 over- and 56 under-expressed genes using 11 ATC cell lines compared with normal thyroid gland; then they validated these data with 10 ATC patient samples, among them, DSTN, HSPA8, Stathmin, LDH-A, ATP5A1, PSM B6, B23, HDP-1, and LDH-B were significantly upregulated in primary ATC patient samples.\n",
      "On the other hand, TG, PBP, and FES were downregulated in primary ATC tissues compared with normal thyroid glands.\n",
      "In other study of ATC cell lines, Akaishi et al.\n",
      "[50] identified transmembrane protein 34 (TMEM34) as specifically downregulated gene.\n",
      "Although it is not a microarray analysis, Passon et al.\n",
      "[46] measured mRNA levels for CREM, PAX8, and NIS in 6 normal thyroid tissues, 22 PTCs, 12 FTCs, and 4 ATCs using quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis.\n",
      "Compared to normal tissues, NIS and PAX8 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in all types of thyroid cancer, especially in ATCs.\n",
      "Conversely, CREM mRNA levels were increased in all types of thyroid cancer including ATC.\n",
      "To find molecular profile related to poor prognosis of thyroid cancer, Montero-Conde et al.\n",
      "[47] examined 7 ATC, 6 PDTC, 24 PTC and 7 FTC tissues by microarray.\n",
      "They comprised 13 dedifferentiated thyroid cancer (ATC and PDTC) vs. 31 WDTC (PTC and FTC) tissues.\n",
      "In this data, they found that 1,031 genes showed more than 2-fold changes of its expression in absolute values.\n",
      "Interestingly, pathways which are known to associated with tumorigenesis were preferentially altered in ATC and PDTC tissues; the MAP kinase signaling pathway, the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway, focal adhesion and cell motility, activation of actin polymerization, and cell cycle.\n",
      "UBE2C, S100A4, and STK5 were significantly overexpressed in ATC and PDTC than WDTC.\n",
      "CDH1, TG, and PAX8 were significantly underexpressed in ATC and PDTC than WDTC, of those the down regulation of TG and PAX8 were also reported by Onda et al.\n",
      "[45] and Passon et al.[46].\n",
      "In other study, Pallante et al.\n",
      "[48], reported downregulation of CBX7 expression using microarray analysis in various thyroid carcinoma-derived cell lines.\n",
      "Then, they validated this finding in various thyroid tissue samples.\n",
      "They show that CBX7 expression decreased with malignancy grade cancer tissues than in normal tissues.\n",
      "Interestingly, in same study, CBX7 loss of heterozygosity occurred in 36.8% (7 of 19 cases) of PTCs and in 68.7% (11 of 16 cases) of ATCs.\n",
      "mRNA for CDKN2A/p16 which is the molecular target of CBX7 and known to be a tumor suppressor, was also highly expressed.\n",
      "As direct study of patient samples, Salvatore et al.\n",
      "[49] did a microarray analysis using 5 ATC compared with 10 PTC and 4 normal thyroid tissue and validated their data with further 22 ATC, 39 PTC and 19 normal thyroid samples.\n",
      "914 genes distinguished ATC from normal tissue: and only 114 genes were found to discriminated normal thyroid from both PTC and ATC.\n",
      "Especially, 54 genes were upregulated in ATC and they are largely involved in cell cycle progression or chromosome instability.\n",
      "Among them, TOP2A, CDC20, CENPA, NEK2, PRC1, CCNB1, CDCA8, TTK, CENPF, and PLK1 expression was ATC-specifically up-regulated.\n",
      "Taken together, the previous studies of genomic expression analysis suggested some of interesting genes and molecular changes using microarray, they could not find clearly the major driver genes or pathways for ATC tumorigenesis.\n",
      "This may be due to the hardness of sample collection or ATC itself could have a very complex heterogeneity.\n",
      "But the technical limitation of microarray itself may contribute also largely.\n",
      "The recently applicable next generation sequencing technology could help to solve this issue so that the molecular contribution of gene expression changes for ATC could be resolved.\n",
      "Since the epigenetic changes of tumor-associated genes are known to play important role and have physiological function in the development of various human cancers and its progression [51, 52], they may also influence to the tumorigenesis of the most malignant form of thyroid cancer, ATC.\n",
      "In PTC cells, genome-wide hypermethylation was found by a recent study using DNA methylation microarray which is revealed to be driven by BRAFV600E signaling [53].\n",
      "Other couple of papers focused more to the change of methylation pattern in ATC.\n",
      "Schagdarsurengin et al.\n",
      "[54] analyzed the methylation pattern of 17 gene promoters in ATC, included those involved in DNA damage avoidance and repair (MGMT, GSTP1), apoptosis (DAPK, UCHL1), cell cycle control (p16, RB), tumor invasion and metastasis (TIMP3, CD26), hormone response (RARβ, ERα, ERβ), signal transduction (PTEN, RASSF1A), regulation of thyrocyte function and growth (TSHR), and other tumor-associated genes (DLC1, SLC5A8).\n",
      "Among these genes, they found that TSHR, MGMT, UCHL1, p16, and DAPK were frequently methylated in ATC.\n",
      "PTEN, as a well-established tumor suppressor, is involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",
      "Hou et al.\n",
      "[55] found that PTEN methylation is necessary to progress the malignancy from benign thyroid adenoma to FTC and aggressive ATC.\n",
      "The methylation of a gene is usually associated with its silencing and the increased methylation of PTEN in ATC is in concordance with decreased or even lack of PTEN expression in previous reports [56, 57].\n",
      "They also found that PTEN methylation in thyroid tumors was closely associated with the activating genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including mutations in Ras, PIK3CA, PTEN gene and PIK3CA amplification [55].\n",
      "Four microRNAs (miRs) (-30d, -125b, -26a, and 30a-5p) were reported by Visone et al.\n",
      "[58] as decreased in ATC compared with normal thyroid tissue.\n",
      "From these, miR-26a and -125b may be targeting HMGA1 and HMGA2 which are known to be involved in thyroid cell transformation [59].\n",
      "In other report by Mitomo et al.\n",
      "[60], found the upregulation of miRs-21, -146b, -221, and -222 and downregulation of -26a, -138, -219, and -345 in thyroid cancer.\n",
      "From these, miR-21 targets E2F (involved in cell cycle and apoptosis) and inhibits PTEN.\n",
      "Interestingly, miR-138 which was found to be downregulated in both study of Visonet's and Mitomo's group [58, 60], targets hTERT which is also found to be reduced.\n",
      "Takakura et al.\n",
      "[61] identified ATC specifically deregulated miRNAs in ATC cell line.\n",
      "They found that overexpression of miR-17-92 cluster of 7 miRNAs (miR-17-3p, -17-5p, -18a, -19a, -19b, -20a, and -92-1), which has a crucial role in cell growth and survival.\n",
      "Additionally, miR-17-3p and -17-5p 5p were overexpressed in 3 out of the 6 ATC patient samples.\n",
      "Although ATC is known to be one of the most aggressive tumor types, there has been little progress in the diagnosis and treatment, largely due to the shortage of genetic information associated with the molecular mechanism of ATC tumorigenesis.\n",
      "In this review, we discussed genetic alterations, structural variations, and epigenetic changes of ATC performed by many scientists to date.\n",
      "As shown, only limited information is available, and few studies were performed using genome-based approaches.\n",
      "Generally, the quantities and qualities of samples for genomic study are very high, so that it is not easy to fulfill the requirements.\n",
      "Therefore, collecting a sufficient number of samples for ATC matching these criteria is a kind of challenge for many scientists.\n",
      "However, current next-generation sequencing techniques require smaller amounts of samples and are applicable for less-qualified samples but provide more accurate results for researchers to evaluate diverse genetic alterations.\n",
      "Recently, the technical advances of genome study developed explosively so that it could provide more comprehensive information on cancer genomics, especially for gene expression, sequence variations, copy number changes, and epigenetic changes [62].\n",
      "Using such technology such as next generation sequencing and big data, rapid progress has been realized in many parts of cancer molecular biology, which in turn contributes to the development of early diagnosis tools and/or targeted molecular therapies.\n",
      "Thus, less-detailed cancer types have been intensively targeted by current genomic studies.\n",
      "For example, many studies have analyzed the genomic alterations associated with lung cancer and reported detailed molecular events that could be used directly in the clinic, such as selection of the most effective drug for each patient.\n",
      "For thyroid cancer, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has deposited the analysis results of -500 thyroid cancer genomes in their public website, which may be published very soon.\n",
      "These analyses will provide a more detailed, multidimensional genomic characterization of thyroid cancer genomes.\n",
      "However, most of the 500 thyroid cancer genomes in TCGA were only from PTC patients, and none was from an ATC patient.\n",
      "It is clear that genomic study of ATC is urgently needed so that the molecular mechanisms of ATC and the genetic and epigenetic changes in ATC could be more preciously understand.\n",
      "Studies on ATC-associated genetic alterations, such as mutations and aberrant structural and epigenetic changes, based on genomic approaches should help to elucidate the molecular consequences of the activation of oncogenes and the loss of tumor suppressors to improve our understanding of tumor biology in ATC.\n",
      "Especially, using recently developmed NGS technology, we will get a deep understanding of ATC-specific molecular mechanisms for successful diagnosis and treatment of this aggressive cancerand further facilitate the search for prognostic and predictive markers and new therapeutic targets for personalized medicine.\n",

      "\n",
      "Over the past decade or so, dramatic developments in our ability to experimentally determine the content and function of genomes have taken place.\n",
      "In particular, next-generation sequencing technologies are now inspiring a new understanding of bacterial transcriptomes on a global scale.\n",
      "In bacterial cells, whole-transcriptome studies have not received attention, owing to the general view that bacterial genomes are simple.\n",
      "However, several recent RNA sequencing results are revealing unexpected levels of complexity in bacterial transcriptomes, indicating that the transcribed regions of genomes are much larger and complex than previously anticipated.\n",
      "In particular, these data show a wide array of small RNAs, antisense RNAs, and alternative transcripts.\n",
      "Here, we review how current transcriptomics are now revolutionizing our understanding of the complexity and regulation of bacterial transcriptomes.\n",
      "An operon, which is an independent unit of biochemical function in the bacterial genome, consists of functionally related genes under the control of a single promoter [1].\n",
      "Thus, the cluster of genes in an operon is transcribed into a single mRNA molecule, referred to as a polycistronic system.\n",
      "This foundational concept of bacterial genome organization has been leading to the discovery of fundamental regulatory mechanisms of bacterial transcription.\n",
      "Bacterial transcription is a biological process that is initiated from a promoter by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme complex, consisting of a single RNAP core unit and a σ-factor subunit.\n",
      "Association with different σ-factor subunits provides promoter specificity to the RNAP core unit.\n",
      "Seven species of σ-factor subunits, for example, have been identified in Escherichia coli, and each participates in the transcription of a specific set of genes in response to growth conditions [2].\n",
      "In addition to the σ-factor association, transcription is either activated or repressed by a wide range of transcription factors, such as the Lac repressor of the lac operon.\n",
      "It was estimated that E. coli encodes roughly 300 regulatory DNA-binding proteins, of which 35% are activators, 43% are repressors, and 22% are dual regulators [3].\n",
      "Bacterial gene expression can be regulated by other regulatory factors, in addition to regulatory DNA-binding proteins, such as small regulatory RNAs and internal promoters within operons, which increase the transcriptome complexity [4, 5].\n",
      "Over the last decade or so, many of these examples have been discovered by quantitative analysis of bacterial transcriptomes, which are defined as the complete set of cellular RNA transcripts.\n",
      "Although DNA microarrays have provided comprehensive information on the transcriptome's complexity in bacterial cells [6, 7], the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically accelerated our analytical capacity via high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) in combination with mRNA enrichment methods [8].\n",
      "This large amount of data has revealed many unexpected features in the bacterial transcriptome, including gene structures, multiple promoters, and RNA-based regulation [7, 9, 10].\n",
      "In some cases, small RNAs (sRNAs) account for 10% to 20% of bacterial RNA products, which have important regulatory roles [8].\n",
      "These new findings suggest that bacterial transcription is much more complicated and subtle than previously thought.\n",
      "In this review, we discuss advances in bacterial transcriptomics, based on RNA-seq, and the current understanding of the complexity and regulation of bacterial transcriptomes.\n",
      "Like eukaryotes, bacterial transcriptome analyses have been initiated by the development of microarrays [11].\n",
      "In particular, high-density tiling arrays, which consist of hundreds of thousands of DNA oligonucleotide probes representing both strands of a given genome, have been massively used to study bacterial transcriptomes.\n",
      "The major advantage of tiling arrays is to interrogate the boundaries of the entire set of transcripts in a cell without taking account of genome annotation [12].\n",
      "Consequently, this technical advance discovered many new RNA molecules, such as regulatory sRNAs.\n",
      "Based on this experimental approach, comprehensive transcriptomics have recently been published for Bacillus subtilis [13], Halobacterium salinarum [14], Mycoplasma pneumonia [6], Caulobacter crescentus [15], Listeria monocytogenes [16], and E. coli [10].\n",
      "One of these studies, for example, focused on the analysis of transcriptionally active regions across an entire genome of Listeria monocytogenes, revealing the complete Listeria operon map as well as various types of RNAs, including at least two of which are involved in virulence in mice [16].\n",
      "Although the high-density tiling arrays were able to interrogate the bacterial transcriptomes without genome annotation, the array-based approach is limited by a high rate of noise due to cross-hybridization, the low dynamic range of detection due to signal saturation, and the inability to detect low copy number of transcripts [17].\n",
      "High-throughput sequencing of RNAs using NGS methods has overcome some drawbacks of the array-based approach.\n",
      "Currently, commercially available NGS systems include the Roche 454 system, based on the pyrosequencing; the Illumina sequencing system, based on sequencing by synthesis; the SOLiD system, based on sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection; and the Ion torrent system, based on the use of a semiconductor-based sequencing technique [18, 19].\n",
      "Also, third-generation sequencing technologies have been actively developed to determine the sequence directly from a single DNA molecule without DNA library amplification [18].\n",
      "Over the conventional Sanger sequencing method, the primary advantage offered by NGS methods is the inexpensive production of large volumes of sequence data, which can be used to identify and quantify rare transcripts without prior knowledge of a particular gene [19, 20].\n",
      "Unlike a hybridization-based array approach, RNA-seq allows unambiguous mapping of transcripts to unique regions of the genome with single-base resolution; hence, there is essentially lower background noise [21].\n",
      "In addition to the accurate quantification of a transcriptome consisting of known genes, RNA-seq allows researchers to determine the correct gene annotation, expressed single-nucleotide polymorphisms, novel genes, and RNAs with high levels of reproducibility for both technical and biological replicates.\n",
      "However, bacterial mRNA can exist as little as 1% to 5% of total RNA; so, mRNA enrichment is a challenging step to obtain sufficient transcript coverage [8].\n",
      "Currently, several methods are being used to remove the rRNA and tRNA fraction from the total RNA pool.\n",
      "Among those methods, terminator 5'-phosphate-dependent exonuclease treatment has been successfully applied to enrich primary transcriptome by reducing processed or degraded RNAs with a 5'-monophosphate end (e.g., rRNAs and tRNAs) [9, 10].\n",
      "To remove the rRNA fraction from the total RNA pool, Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kits, using biotinylated probes that selectively bind rRNA, have been used successfully for a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to human (Epicentre).\n",
      "The requirements of the ideal RNA-seq method are strand-specificity and quantitation across a wide dynamic range [22, 23].\n",
      "However, a common strategy of an RNA-seq library preparation is to convert single-stranded RNA molecules into double-stranded cDNA fragments of certain sizes, flanked by platform-specific adapter sequences.\n",
      "This means that double-strand cDNA is synthesized from randomly primed hexamers, which cannot provide information on the transcribed strands.\n",
      "A major shortcoming of conventional RNA-seq methods is therefore the lack of RNA polarity information.\n",
      "The polarity of RNA transcripts is very useful in facilitating subsequent computational analyses, including the correction of novel gene annotations and the detection of overlapping genetic features encoded in opposite orientations.\n",
      "In particular, polarity information is important for understanding small bacterial genomes, in which genes are densely coded, with overlapping untranslated regions (UTRs) or open reading frames (ORFs) [23].\n",
      "However, the recently developed strand-specific RNA-seq analysis enhances the value of bacterial transcriptomics.\n",
      "In terms of how to mark the transcribed strand, several methods can be categorized largely into two approaches.\n",
      "One is marking a strand by orientation-dependent adaptor ligation to the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA transcript, such as RNA ligation [24], SMART [25], NNSR priming [26], and SMART-RNA ligation [23].\n",
      "The other is marking one strand by chemical modification, either on the RNA itself by bisulfite treatment [27] or on the second strand cDNA by dUTP incorporation [28].\n",
      "Among several strand-specific RNA-seq methods, the dUTP method was identified as the leading protocol because of its wide range of coverage and availability of paired-end sequencing (Fig.1A) [23].\n",
      "Briefly, the dUTP method starts with converting the initial mRNA into cDNA.\n",
      "This first cDNA strand is used as a template for second cDNA strand synthesis, which incorporates dUTP instead of dTTP.\n",
      "After marking both ends of the cDNA by ligation of adaptor sequences, the second strand is subsequently degraded by uracil-N-glycosylase treatment, which selectively removes the uracil site on the DNA.\n",
      "Finally, the remaining first-strand cDNA, with directional adaptor sequences, can be sequenced on the Illumina Platform using both single-read and paired-end sequencing [28].\n",
      "With these technological breakthroughs, several bacterial RNA-seq studies showed that bacterial transcription is not as simple as previously thought [10, 29-32].\n",
      "For example, in the transcriptomic analyses of Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli, Vibrio cholera, and Xanthomonas campestris pv.\n",
      "vesicatoria, it was revealed that noncoding RNAs play an important role in diverse regulatory mechanisms [29-32].\n",
      "In addition, the complexity of the E. coli transcription unit indicates that bacterial transcription is regulated by the differential use of diverse transcription start sites (TSSs), with corresponding transcription factors under given environmental conditions [10].\n",
      "In bacteria, cellular RNA comprises primary transcripts that are marked by a 5'-triphosphate (5'PPP) group and processed or degraded RNAs that carry either a 5'-monophosphate (5'P) or 5'-hydroxyl group (5'OH) [7, 9].\n",
      "In particular, primary transcriptome analysis is beneficial for improving the annotation of any sequenced bacterial genome.\n",
      "Due to the absence of a poly(A) tail at the 3'-end and the instability of mRNAs with very short half-lives, however, bacterial primary transcriptome analysis has been challenging [8].\n",
      "Also, cellular RNA was considered to consist mainly of rRNA and tRNA in prokaryotic cells; therefore, mRNA enrichment is essential to determine the primary transcriptome from RNA-seq.\n",
      "Differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) enriches RNA samples for primary transcripts by use of a 5'P-dependent terminator exonuclease (TEX) that specifically degrades RNAs carrying a 5'P, leading to relative enrichment of primary transcripts and depletion of processed RNAs.\n",
      "Then, the 5'-end positions of the primary transcripts can be identified by comparison of cDNA libraries generated with and without TEX treatment (Fig.1B) [9, 31, 33-36].\n",
      "The 5'-end of RNA transcripts, corresponding to the TSS, is mostly related with the regulation of transcribed genes, including promoters, ribosome binding sites, transcription factor binding sites, antisense RNAs (asRNAs), and other regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs).\n",
      "Bacterial TSSs have been identified mainly through primer extension and S1 nuclease protection mapping assay, but these methods are labor-intensive (Fig.2A) [37].\n",
      "High-density tiling arrays have also been used for large-scale TSS mapping in E. coli and Caulobacter crescentus, with limited mapping resolution [15, 38].\n",
      "In addition, indirect TSS identification in the E. coli transcriptome has been made by RNAP chromatin immunoprecipitation, coupled with microarray (ChIP-chip) [39].\n",
      "More recently, dRNA-seq has been developed to map TSSs in Helicobacter pylori [9].\n",
      "It revealed 1907 TSSs, which were found in upstream regions of annotated mRNAs within annotated genes on the same DNA strand or on the opposite DNA strand and in regions without any annotated genes in proximity.\n",
      "In addition to the 337 primary operons defined by the TSSs, it obtained 126 additional suboperons and 66 monocistrons overlapping the 3' part of polycistrons in H. pylori.\n",
      "Alternative TSSs for the determination of suboperons (or transcription units) have been determined through the integration of massive-scale sequencing and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) method in E. coli (Fig.2B) [10].\n",
      "The consecutive iterations of experiments identified a total of 4,133 TSSs.\n",
      "Interestingly, it was found that ~35% of promoters contained multiple TSSs, defining alternative transcription units in the E. coli genome.\n",
      "For example, the transcription factor Lrp activates stpA, encoding an H-NS-like DNA-binding protein from a dominant TSS position (2,796,558).\n",
      "However, two other TSSs are used less in the exponential growth phase.\n",
      "These results show that the bacterial transcriptome is actively regulated by means of alternative TSSs in response to differential environmental conditions.\n",
      "dRNA-seq method has been applied to detect genomewide TSS maps in other bacterial species.\n",
      "Interestingly, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis contains 3,537 TSSs, 64% of which were assigned to asRNAs or ncRNAs [40].\n",
      "In conclusion, the dRNA-seq approach is a strong tool for annotation of operon structures, transcription units (or suboperons), and detection of TSSs, providing important insights into the understanding of a comprehensive transcription regulatory network.\n",
      "In bacteria, regulatory ncRNAs have emerged as key players, acting by various mechanisms to modulate metabolic, physiological, and pathogenic processes, as well as bacterial adaptive immunity [41].\n",
      "The largest group of regulatory ncRNAs consists of regulatory sRNAs, which affect the transcription, translation, and stability of target mRNAs through base pairing with the targets (Fig.2C).\n",
      "These sRNAs can work in cis by overlapping their target genes encoded on the opposite DNA strand of the same genomic locus or in trans by targeting genes located elsewhere on the chromosome [41, 42].\n",
      "Therefore, the discovery and characterization of bacterial sRNAs are critical for the understanding of the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes.\n",
      "Primary transcriptome analysis allows one to detect the presence of sRNAs at their abundance in a genome-scale by measuring nonprotein-coding RNA transcripts.\n",
      "For instance, an unexpected 60 sRNAs have been discovered in the primary transcriptome analysis of H. pylori, indicating that the complexity of gene expression in the small H. pylori genome is increased by genomewide antisense transcription [9].\n",
      "In this way, many sRNAs were recently discovered from various bacterial species, including the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia (13 sRNAs), Salmonella Typhi Ty2 (55 sRNAs), and L. monocytogenes (50 sRNAs).\n",
      "The sRNAs from B. cenocepacia and L. monocytogenes were induced during niche switching and involved in virulence, respectively [16, 43, 44].\n",
      "Furthermore, comparing of the sRNAs with global gene expression could be facilitated in the analysis of a set of genes that are mainly involved in the pathogenic features of B. cenocepacia.\n",
      "In addition, immunoprecipitation of specific RNA-binding proteins can lead to selectively enriched sRNAs [8].\n",
      "The first attempt at sRNA analysis, based on the NGS technique (RIP-seq), was carried out in Salmonella [29].\n",
      "Using the RNA-binding property of Hfq proteins, Hfq-associated RNAs could be enriched and analyzed by immunoprecipitation of Hfq-RNA complexes, followed by deep sequencing.\n",
      "Through this study, more than twice as many new sRNAs were discovered over previously known sRNAs [29].\n",
      "These results indicate that sRNAs are abundant in the bacterial transcriptome, representing its regulatory complexity.\n",
      "RNA-seq technology has uncovered that 5% to 25% of all protein-coding genes encoded on the sense strand interact with the asRNAs that are transcribed from the antisense strand, thereby regulating their transcription, translation, or degradation (Fig.2C) [8].\n",
      "These transcripts are named asRNAs, which overlapped partially with the 5'-UTR or 3'-UTR of their target protein-coding genes [16].\n",
      "The abundance of these transcripts has been revealed in several bacterial genomes, including Sallmonella Typhimurium [29], B. Subtilis [13], E. coli [45], Staphylococcus aureus [46], and M. pneumonia [6].\n",
      "Using RNaseIII, which specifically degrades double-stranded short RNAs, for example, stable sRNA molecules that map symmetrically to both strands were enriched from Staphylococcus aureus.\n",
      "RNA-seq of the enriched RNA molecules resulted in the detection of 1387 ORFs, which covers 50% of the antisense strand [46].\n",
      "Another study identified ~1,000 novel asRNAs in E. coli using high-throughput sequencing [45].\n",
      "Briefly, the unique 5' end of the primary transcriptome was analyzed by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to convert 5'PPP groups into 5'P, followed by ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide and reverse-transcription with a random primer.\n",
      "Further studies of several asRNAs suggested that they are involved in a wide range of cellular mechanisms, such as the translational regulation of the quorum-sensing gene rpaR in Rhodopseudomonas palustris [47].\n",
      "Based on the abundance of transcripts, it has been suggested that the number of asRNAs correlates negatively with genome size [7].\n",
      "Large asRNAs could be the consequence of genome reduction with transcriptional regulation, mediated at the RNA level.\n",
      "Taken together, RNA-seq approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of the abundance of asRNAs in bacteria [42].\n",
      "With emerging advances in NGS, RNA-seq has uncovered the complexity of the bacterial transcriptome.\n",
      "Although transcriptional regulation by asRNAs, novel ncRNAs, and alternative splicing events have been well known in eukaryotes, similar regulatory events in prokaryotes have been newly elucidated in recent studies.\n",
      "In accordance with technological developments, several approaches for computational pipeline and bioinformatics analysis have been also progressed.\n",
      "Here, we review sequencing methods, their advantages, and several key results for bacterial transcriptome analysis.\n",
      "Undoubtedly, RNA-seq is having a breathtaking impact on our understanding of biological systems and will provide entirely new insights into the biological parts in living genomes.\n",
      "Furthermore, the concept of artificial genetic circuits has been advanced in synthetic biology, due to their simplicity in manipulating the cell [48].\n",
      "For example, promoters, sRNAs, ncRNAs, and ribosome-binding sites are considered as biological parts in a cell, which can be used to assemble new genetic circuits, such as switches or oscillators.\n",
      "A wide range of biological parts can be screened and listed up from transcriptome analysis by NGS.\n",

      "\n",
      "Genetic studies on facial morphology targeting healthy populations are fundamental in understanding the specific genetic influences involved; yet, most studies to date, if not all, have been focused on congenital diseases accompanied by facial anomalies.\n",
      "To study the specific genetic cues determining facial morphology, we estimated familial correlations and heritabilities of 14 facial measurements and 3 latent factors inferred from a factor analysis in a subset of the Korean population.\n",
      "The study included a total of 229 individuals from 38 families.\n",
      "We evaluated a total of 14 facial measurements using 2D digital photographs.\n",
      "We performed factor analysis to infer common latent variables.\n",
      "The heritabilities of 13 facial measurements were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and ranged from 0.25 to 0.61.\n",
      "Of these, the heritability of intercanthal width in the orbital region was found to be the highest (h2 = 0.61, SE = 0.14).\n",
      "Three factors (lower face portion, orbital region, and vertical length) were obtained through factor analysis, where the heritability values ranged from 0.45 to 0.55.\n",
      "The heritability values for each factor were higher than the mean heritability value of individual original measurements.\n",
      "We have confirmed the genetic influence on facial anthropometric traits and suggest a potential way to categorize and analyze the facial portions into different groups.\n",

      "The human face is made from the fusion of 5 prominences (the fronto-nasal prominence and two pairs of maxillary and mandibular prominences), which occur from the 4th to 10th weeks of development, where defects in the process result in many kinds of facial clefts [2].\n",
      "Studies on human facial morphology can impact various areas, including plastic and dental surgery, facial anatomy, reconstruction, and constitutional diagnosis [3, 4], as well as studies on anthropology and genetics.\n",
      "Of these, the implication of genetic factors on facial morphology has been considered important in understanding hereditary disorders as well as tracing the anthropological origin [5, 6].\n",
      "Genetic effects on facial measurements have been investigated considerably in the past.\n",
      "Several twin studies evaluated the genetic and non-genetic influence on facial traits [7-10].\n",
      "One classical twin study showed significant genetic variance of alveolar bone height (h2 = 0.36) using intraclass correlation between twins (MZr = 0.70 and DZr = 0.52) [7].\n",
      "Another twin study found significant sex differences of genetic variance in anterior face height and no genetic influence on angular measurements [8].\n",
      "On the other hand, several angle measurements, such as soft-tissue facial angle and Holdaway angle, were shown to have genetic effects [11] in a Turkish Anatolian siblings study.\n",
      "Family studies, in addition to the twin studies, have reported several key findings regarding the genetic contribution of facial traits [12-17].\n",
      "In 1991, Kohn [13] found an important role of genetic influence on craniofacial growth.\n",
      "A family study based on ethnically homogeneous Chuvasha pedigrees has found that genetic factors substantially contribute to head shape, where the unadjusted estimates of heritability were found to range from 0.35 to 0.71 [14].\n",
      "In a recent study using the Hallstatt skull, it was shown that the additive genetic variation accounted for approximately 30% of the phenotypic variation in total facial dimensions (maximum facial breadth, length, and height) [16].\n",
      "Familial correlation can also be used as an important indicator to grasp genetic and environmental proportions.\n",
      "A morphological characteristics study based on 125 Belgian families has found evidence of genetic determination in longitudinal body measurements and, to a lesser extent, in soft tissues and in nose or mouth regions [12].\n",
      "There exist a variety of complex indicators for the measurement of facial size and length.\n",
      "A common characterization of facial measurements by reducing the dimension using factor analysis can be very helpful in understanding the genetics behind facial morphology.\n",
      "In recent years, most studies based on this concept assessed 2 common factors: horizontal components (HOCs) and vertical components (VECs).\n",
      "Several investigations found that the genetic effect was estimated differently between 2 factors [8, 10, 14, 18, 19].\n",
      "In these studies, however, the extraction of common latent variables in facial complex measurements was only limited to HOCs and VECs.\n",
      "In understanding the implication of genetic influence of facial morphology, other characterization methods in addition to the horizontal and vertical component could also be useful.\n",
      "Although many researchers have studied the genetic effects on facial morphology, most of them have focused on congenital diseases accompanied by facial anomalies.\n",
      "Genetic studies on facial morphology targeting healthy population of various ethnicities are therefore still lagging behind.\n",
      "The aims of this study were to infer common latent factors by analyzing the pattern found in a factor analysis of 14 facial measurements from the Korean population and investigate the existence of genetic effects for the factors through estimation of familial correlations and heritability.\n",

      "During the first and second phase of this survey, 114 and 164 individuals were collected, respectively.\n",
      "Subjects with poor-quality photographs were excluded from analysis.\n",
      "The study included a total of 229 individuals from 38 families, and of these, one family had a large extended pedigree.\n",

      "Digital photographs used for facial measurements have the advantages of obtaining quick and permanent data [20].\n",
      "To minimize the potential variability in the measurements among different centers, a single digital camera, with a standard protocol, was employed throughout the collection of data.\n",
      "To correct for distance variable, a standard sliding caliper was held by the subjects while taking photographs.\n",
      "The resulting images were sent to KIOM from each center.\n",
      "Twenty-five landmarks were selected and produced as described [21] using Image J program, an image processing program developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (Fig.1).\n",
      "Each of these landmarks was recorded as coordinates in this program.\n",
      "A single measurement can be generated, representing the shortest distance between any of the 2 landmark coordinates of choice.\n",
      "Fourteen of such measurements described below were selected, which best represented the facial characteristic [21].\n",
      "A total of 14 facial measurements in 5 regions (head and face, orbital, nose, mouth, and ears) were evaluated.\n",
      "For the head and face region, 6 measurements (physiognomical height of the face [tr-gn], height of the forehead I [tr-g], special upper face height [g-sn], height of the lower face [sn-gn], width of the face [zy-zy], and width of the mandible [go-go]) were recorded.\n",

      "The nose region had 3 measurements: height of the nose (n-sn), width of the nose (al-al), and nasal protrusion (sn-prn).\n",
      "One measurement each was taken from the mouth and ear regions: width of the mouth (ch-ch) and length of the auricle (sa-sba) (Table 1, Fig.1).\n",
      "To minimize intermeasurement bias, all the measurements were taken by a single, well-trained personnel.\n",
      "To verify the robustness and reliability of the measurement method employed herein, we also recorded the intraobserver precision of all 14 measurements on the 20 subsamples, of which age and sex were taken into consideration.\n",

      "To estimate the common latent variable in facial measurements, we implemented factor analysis using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n",

      "PEDINFO option in S.A.G.E.\n",
      "(2009; Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology, Release 6.0.1; http://darwin.cwru.edu/) was used to understand family information, such as offspring N and sibling N.\n",

      "In this modeling, the significant covariate variables were adjusted by screen option of the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR) package [24].\n",
      "As a result, the residual variation, which is the remainder of the variation among phenotypes, excluding the portion pertaining to be important covariates, was obtained and applied to approximate the familial correlation and heritability.\n",

      "Familial correlations and heritabilities of residual variation, adjusted by significant covariates, are presented in Table 4.\n",

      "There are several distinctive features of facial morphology found in Koreans compared to western populations.\n",
      "First, the nose of Koreans tends to be relatively shorter and broader than that found in Italians [26], Caucasians [27], and Latvian [28] populations.\n",
      "Koreans also have a relatively narrower face (zy-zy) and wider mandible (go-go), and eyes (en-ex) when compared to Italians and wider intercanthal width (en-en), narrower width of the mouth (ch-ch), and longer special upper face height (g-sn) and length of the auricle (sa-sba) than Caucasians.\n",
      "Compared to Latvians, Koreans have broader (zy-zy and go-go) and longer (tr-gn) faces, narrower binocular width (ex-ex) and length of the eye fissure (en-ex), and wider intercanthal width (en-en).\n",
      "The heritabilities that were significant for 13 phenotypes had a wide range of values (h2 = 0.25-0.61).\n",
      "Previous papers have reported estimated heritabilities of craniofacial anthropometric traits, and the results have been in agreement with ours.\n",
      "In one study based on an Indian population, the heritabilities of nasal height and breadth were 0.42 and 0.50; in addition, that of facial height and bizygomatic breadth were 0.41 and 0.61 [29].\n",
      "Another study enrolling a Chuvasha pedigree reported that the heritabilities of nasal height, physiognomic facial height, bizygomatic breadth, and bigonial breadth were 0.42, 0.38, 0.58, and 0.50, respectively [14].\n",
      "The other paper targeting orbital traits of Brazilians reported that the heritabilities of intercanthal width, biocular width, and length of the eye fissure were 0.39, 0.34, and 0.51 [30].\n",
      "Recently, we reported the heritabilities and suggestive genetic loci associated with ocular and nasal traits in an isolated Mongolian population [31].\n",
      "The heritabilities in Mongolians (h2 = 0.48-0.90) were slightly higher than those of Koreans (h2 = 0.25-0.61).\n",
      "The difference between the two populations can be explained by the low level of genetic heterogeneity and environmental effects in the isolated population model.\n",
      "Several groups have reported that vertical facial variables displayed greater genetic effects than horizontal facial variables [8, 9, 32].\n",
      "However, another group has challenged this by presenting an opposite result, although it was found not to be statistically significant [14].\n",
      "The results obtained in our study support for a greater genetic effect of the horizontal craniofacial variables, where vertical variables (tr-gn, tr-g, g-sn, and sn-gn) displayed less heritability than the horizontal variables (zy-zy and go-go).\n",
      "A similar pattern was also observed for the nose region.\n",
      "We were able to identify 3 latent factors related to facial measurements through factor analysis (Table 5).\n",
      "Factor 2 showed relation to the orbital region: intercanthal width (en-en), biocular width (ex-ex), and length of the eye fissure (en-ex).\n",
      "When we consider the early development of the face, there are very unique processes for making eyes and orbits.\n",
      "Factor 2 may be related with one of the common regulators controlling these processes.\n",
      "Factor 3 included vertical length values in the upper face region (special upper face height [g-sn] and height of the nose [n-sn], and physiognomical height of the face [tr-gn]).\n",
      "Because all three values are related with vertical length of the nose (n-sn), this factor may be related with the early developmental process of the nose from the lateral and/or medial nasal prominence.\n",
      "Factor 1 was mainly related to the lower portion of the face-height of the lower face (sn-gn), width of the mandible (go-go), width of the nose (al-al), and width of the mouth (ch-ch) and this part was made from the maxillary and mandibular prominences of the first pharyngeal arch.\n",
      "However, there remains the possibility that Factor 1 is related with a general factor rather than a specific regulator, because 7 of the 14 measurement values had loading scores above or very close to 0.6.\n",
      "Such findings are indicative of a necessity to categorize each facial portion into different classes to improve our understanding of facial genetics.\n",
      "In previous studies, however, the concept of factor analysis in the genetic study of facial morphology was mainly confined to horizontal and vertical measures.\n",
      "Hence, this new concept of facial regions in the current report may provide significant insight into the genetic study of facial morphology.\n",
      "Factors that are explained by a common facial variable can have a higher genetic variance than each facial measurement [33].\n",
      "Factor 1, related to the lower face, also indicated the highest genetic variance (h2 = 0.55, SE = 0.12), which was significantly higher than the mean of each trait (mean h2 = 0.36).\n",
      "The estimated heritabilities for Factor 2 and Factor 3 also showed a similar trend (h2 = 0.52, SE = 0.15; mean h2 = 0.44 and h2 = 0.45, SE = 0.13; mean h2 = 0.34, respectively) (Table 6).\n",
      "They suggest that the factors reflect the genetic effect well than when compared to each original measurement in the regions.\n",
      "Additionally, this study employed a bivariate model to investigate shared genetic effects for all pairs of facial measurements within each factor.\n",
      "We estimated the genetic and environment correlations and found 5 pairs with a statistically significant genetic correlation: 1 for Factor 1 and 2 each for Factor 2 and Factor 3.\n",
      "The significant genetic correlation ranged from 0.74 to 1.00, which suggested that there exists a large genetic portion simultaneously affecting facial measurements in each factor.\n",
      "To date, various study designs have been employed for identifying the genetic effects of a specific trait where, in general, family, twin, or sibling designs were preferentially chosen.\n",
      "Amongst these three, the family design has many advantages.\n",
      "Firstly, familial correlation and relative risk can be estimated [34].\n",
      "Secondly, a family study is likely to increase statistical power for finding causative genes and inheritance modes [35] where, especially, a large expended pedigree provides sufficient evidence of linkage as well as maximum statistical power [36].\n",
      "A variety of methods for measuring facial length or size have been introduced by many researchers [37].\n",
      "Simple and direct measurement using calipers takes a lot of time and effort and has the probability of incorporating errors between different observers.\n",
      "Another method of facial measurement is radiographic cephalometry, which has the advantage of observing hard tissue, such as bones, but this method is not suited for facial morphology, since it requires high cost and is time-consuming and is thus not suited for large-scale epidemiology.\n",
      "An alternative method used in this study was 2D digital photography.\n",
      "Although this method is difficult to locate bony structures under the skin, which is necessary to determine facial landmarks as well as measure curved surfaces, this has several advantages.\n",
      "The pictures are quickly obtainable and the measurements can be permanently stored.\n",
      "Observers can be trained easily for precise and unbiased measurement.\n",
      "Radiographic cephalometry is selected for clinical patient care, whereas photographic method is better for investigating facial morphology in a large epidemiological study [20], thereby suggesting that each method for facial measurement should be chosen to fit the purpose of the study; we found our choice of photographic method to be reliable and useful in our study.\n",
      "Our study has several new aspects and advantages: we provide the first reliable data for facial morphology for the Korean population; we tried a new approach to study faces using factor analysis; and the family data containing a large extended pedigree used in this study provided high statistical power for estimating heritability.\n",
      "Yet, this study is not without caveats.\n",
      "The most obvious limitation in this study is the small sample size.\n",
      "Since the number of subjects was not large enough, the familial correlations between first-degree relatives, especially most sibling pairs, might not have been statistically significant.\n",
      "In our results, the familial correlations of parent-offspring pairs were relatively more significant than those of sibling pairs (Table 4).\n",
      "This is probably due to a relatively small number of sibling pairs than parent-offspring pairs.\n",
      "For the heritability estimation of the 14 phenotypes, the value for width of the mouth (ch-ch) was found to be the smallest and not statistically significant.\n",
      "This may be due to the change in facial expression while taking photographs (emotion or tension), causing variability in width of the mouth (ch-ch).\n",
      "Facial tension created during unusual situations, such as while taking photographs, can influence the measurements, especially for the width of mouth, because of the likelihood for this region to be affected by psychological tension compared to other measurement parts.\n",
      "In addition, we were not able to provide enough data for each age in children, which is an important basis for the diagnosis of congenital facial anomalies.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have verified the genetic effect on facial anthropometric traits and suggested a potential way to categorize and analyze the facial portions into different groups.\n",
      "Despite many reports on congenital diseases with accompanying facial anomalies, the understanding of common genetic mechanisms, including specific genes that determine the facial morphology in general healthy populations, is still obscure.\n",
      "Our report is a step towards understanding this.\n",
      "Validation with the results of other studies involving varying populations, in addition to studies on genetic linkage association or biologic studies, is warranted for furthering our understanding of this subject.\n",

      "Recent studies using genome-wide association analysis have identified genes and variations that correlate with human visible phenotypes and developed phenotype prediction programs.\n",
      "However, most prediction models were constructed and validated based on genotype and phenotype information on Europeans.\n",
      "Therefore, we need to validate prediction models in diverse ethnic populations.\n",
      "In this study, we selected potentially useful variations for forensic science that are associated with hair and eye color, iris pattern, and facial morphology, based on previous studies, and analyzed their frequencies in 1,920 Koreans.\n",
      "Among 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 10 SNPs were polymorphic, 6 SNPs were very rare (minor allele frequency < 0.005), and 4 SNPs were monomorphic in the Korean population.\n",
      "Even though the usability of these SNPs should be verified by an association study in Koreans, this study provides 10 potential SNP markers for forensic science for externally visible characteristics in the Korean population.\n",
      "DNA genotyping has been used in forensic science for over 30 years for human identification by using short tandem repeat (STR) markers, which are highly polymorphic variants [1].\n",
      "Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also been used for forensic marker, because they may provide better profiling from degraded DNA samples than STRs and do not involve repetitive sequences that may make stutter artifacts, which complicates STR profiling interpretation [2, 3].\n",
      "SNPs for forensic analyses can be used for human identification, kinship analysis, inferring biogeographic ancestry, and estimating appearance traits [4].\n",
      "In general, forensic DNA profiling is used for identifying persons compared with profiles of known suspects or missing persons included in a DNA database.\n",

      "Other genes were also identified as contributing to hair, eye, and skin color variations, such as IRF4, KITLG, SLC24A4, SLC45A2, TYRP1, TYP, and ASIP [15].\n",
      "Recent studies using genome-wide association analysis have identified genes and variations correlating with human visible phenotypes and developed a phenotype prediction program [16-19].\n",
      "HIrisPlex is capable of predicting hair and eye color from DNA with 24 SNP variations [19].\n",
      "Six of the 24 SNPs used for eye color prediction in the HIrisPlex program are rs12913832 (HERC2), rs1800407 (OCA2), rs12896399 (SLC24A4), rs16891982 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs1393350 (TYR), and rs12203592 (IRF4), and 4 of these SNPs within HERC2, OCA2, SLC45A2, and IRF4 are also used for hair color prediction.\n",
      "To predict hair color and hair color shade, HIrisPlex uses 22 SNPs as follows: N29insA, rs11547464, rs885479, rs1805008, rs1805005, rs1805006, rs1805007, rs1805009, Y152OCH, rs2228479, and rs1110400 from the MC1R gene, rs28777 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs16891982 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs12821256 (KITLG), rs4959270 (EXOC2), rs12203592 (IRF4), rs1042602 (TYR), rs1800407 (OCA2), rs2402130 (SLC24A4), rs12913832 (HERC2), rs2378249 (PIGU/ASIP), and rs683 (TYRP1).\n",
      "The results of these 24 SNPs when their minor alleles are input into HIrisPlex are used to predict the color of an individual with the highest probability of the 3 eye color categories (brown, blue, or intermediate) and 4 hair color categories (blond, brown, red, and black).\n",
      "On average, their prediction accuracy was 69.5% for blonde hair, 78.5% for brown, 80% for red, 87.5% for black hair, and over 90% for blue and brown eyes.\n",
      "Few GWASs on color-related phenotype have been carried out in Asian populations [20, 21].\n",

      "Prof. Jihyun Kim at Yonsei Univerisity invited three renowned metagenomics researchers to write review articles.\n",
      "In the first one, a group headed by Prof. Hana Yi at Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea surveys databases and analysis tools in metagenomics.\n",

      "Title: Analytical Tools and Databases for Metagenomics in the Next-Generation Sequencing Era\n",
      "\n",
      "Metagenomics has become one of the indispensable tools in microbial ecology for the last few decades, and a new revolution in metagenomic studies is now about to begin, with the help of recent advances of sequencing techniques.\n",
      "The massive data production and substantial cost reduction in next-generation sequencing have led to the rapid growth of metagenomic research both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n",
      "It is evident that metagenomics will be a standard tool for studying the diversity and function of microbes in the near future, as fingerprinting methods did previously.\n",
      "As the speed of data accumulation is accelerating, bioinformatic tools and associated databases for handling those datasets have become more urgent and necessary.\n",
      "To facilitate the bioinformatics analysis of metagenomic data, we review some recent tools and databases that are used widely in this field and give insights into the current challenges and future of metagenomics from a bioinformatics perspective.\n",
      "Metagenomics is defined as the study of the metagenome, which is total genomic DNA from environmental samples.\n",
      "Metagenomics has long been one of the major research tools in microbial ecology since the term was first used in 1998 [1].\n",
      "Metagenomic information allows for a more in-depth understanding of the ecological role, metabolism, and evolutionary history of microbes in a given ecosystem by analyzing environmental DNA directly without prior cultivation.\n",
      "Metagenomics has made unprecedented contributions to microbial ecology; among them, one of the most outstanding discoveries of metagenomics is the first description of proteorhodopsin in marine bacteria [2].\n",
      "Moreover, many hypotheses and questions in ecology and evolutionary biology have been tested and answered through metagenomic research.\n",
      "For example, Fuhrman et al.\n",
      "[3] tested a latitudinal gradient of biodiversity, which is one of the most widely recognized patterns in macroscopic taxa, on marine bacteria, and more recently, the taxonomic and functional distinction of bacteria in desert compared to other nondesert biomes was investigated through cross biome comparison using shotgun metagenomics [4].\n",
      "Varied definitions converge into two main categories, targeted metagenomics and shotgun metagenomics, depending on their purpose and target materials.\n",
      "This review offers an overview of the tools and databases that are widely used in both targeted and shotgun metagenomics, in particular emphasizing on metagenome sequences generated by recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.\n",
      "The recent development of sequencing technologies has enabled us to assess much deeper layers of microbial communities by generating tons of nucleotide sequences at lower costs.\n",
      "NGS technologies have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology, as they have allowed researchers to reach the true level of diversity more closely through more in-depth sequencing.\n",
      "There are various applications using these NGS platforms, ranging from single-gene targeted sequencing to whole-genome sequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing.\n",
      "Details about the principles and applications of each NGS technique have already been reviewed elsewhere [5].\n",
      "The first NGS platform, pyrosequencer (GS20), generated just 20 Mb per run with a read length of 100 bp on average.\n",
      "A recent version of pyrosequencer (GS-FLX Titanium) has an advantage over other NGS techniques, especially 16S rRNA gene-based surveys, as it produces around ~500 Mb per run with a longer read length (400-500 bp), which is sufficient to cover partial hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA.\n",
      "Illumina sequencing produces many more reads with cheaper price that are more accurate (accuracy of >99%) than 454 platforms (accuracy of 98.93%) [6] but is somewhat limited in certain fields due to the relatively shorter read length (<100 bp) of early versions.\n",
      "However, Illumina became more popular, since it gradually improved readable lengths (i.e., 2 × 250 bp in MiSeq).\n",
      "More recently, Pacific Biosciences has released a new sequencing technology, PacBio RS, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies introduced GridION/MinION devices, both of which allow single-molecule sequencing with a much longer read length.\n",
      "However, further improvements are necessary for use in practice due to the high intrinsic errors (10% to 15% in PacBio and around 4% in GridION) [7].\n",
      "Since the first launch of the NGS platform in 2006, novel sequencing technologies have been developed continuously and rapidly.\n",
      "As a result, massive sequence data produced by NGS technologies are accumulating at an unflagging rate.\n",
      "However, the computing power and development of algorithms needed to deal with the huge datasets efficiently are not keeping up with the speed of data production.\n",
      "For example, access to sequence data is still hampered by unsuitable data storage systems, such as short read archive (SRA), and many early papers were not accompanied by data deposition into public databases.\n",
      "Repositories should be big enough to be ready to allow the increasing volume of upcoming sequence data, and all data must be deposited in a standardized manner.\n",
      "In addition to the shortage of data storage space and confounding submission formats, the characteristics of the produced sequence data pose another problem in further processing.\n",
      "For instance, shorter read length, which is an inevitable limit of high-throughput sequencing, is a barrier for sequence assembly, and the relatively higher rates of sequencing errors compared with previous Sanger methods also make it hard to recover genuine sequences.\n",
      "Targeted metagenomics refers to a metagenomic approach that surveys genes or genomic regions of particular interest by targeted methods (activity- and sequence-driven studies) [8].\n",
      "Sequence-driven targeted metagenomics is normally conducted by PCR-based directed sequencing of environmental genomic DNA.\n",
      "Ribosomal RNA genes (e.g., small subunit [SSU] and large subunit [LSU]) have been used as taxonomic marker genes for identifying microbial species.\n",
      "The characteristics of having both highly conserved and variable regions have allowed for accurate taxonomic identification and made it easier to design primers targeting the whole taxa of interest.\n",
      "Although taxonomic resolution of the 16S rRNA gene is not sufficient for delineating taxa at the species or strain level in some cases [9], the SSU of ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) has been used widely as a standard marker gene in prokaryotes.\n",
      "For the last few decades, molecular methods to assess microbial diversity have focused on rRNA genes using probe-based approaches, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization and microarray, fingerprinting methods, and molecular cloning.\n",
      "Some of them are still in use, but in this review, we focus mainly on sequence data generated by recent NGS techniques.\n",
      "Microbial community profiling using taxonomic marker genes (e.g., 16S rRNA gene) commonly uses an operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based approach, as the sequence-based species definition in microbes is still vague and current public databases still do not reach the full extent of microbial diversity, despite the massive sequencing efforts.\n",
      "This OTU-based approach is now generally accepted in most microbial community studies based on environmental samples.\n",
      "Over the last few years, 454 pyrosequencing has been a major source of generating amplicon metagenomics data among NGS platforms due to its capability of producing a relatively longer read length.\n",
      "Therefore, bioinformatic analysis tools dealing with sequence data have been developed and tailored for pyrosequencing results.\n",
      "More detailed information about the algorithms and processes at each step can be found in several other reviews [7, 10].\n",
      "In this part, we introduce recent tools and databases and provide brief explanations about how they work in the course of the analysis workflow (Table 1) [11-29].\n",
      "The first part of an analysis of NGS-generated data starts from filtering out 'noise' sequences.\n",
      "Most metagenomic studies based on single- or multiple-gene amplicons have used 454 pyrosequencing due to its advantage of producing longer read lengths, and currently available denoising algorithms have also been developed for that purpose.\n",
      "The denoising process per se does not remove actual sequences but keeps abundant information on erroneous sequences by retaining representative reads.\n",
      "Several denoising algorithms have been suggested so far.\n",
      "PyroNoise [11] implements a flowgram clustering method, and other denoising tools, such as Denoiser [12], DADA [13], and Acacia [14], use sequence abundance information on the denoising process.\n",
      "Similarly, single-linkage preclustering can be used before performing the formal OTU clustering to reduce 'noise' sequences generated by PCR and sequencing errors [30].\n",
      "It first ranks sequences in order of decreasing abundance, and rarer sequences within a certain threshold are merged into the original abundant sequences.\n",
      "Once denoising and additional quality control processes are completed, chimeric sequences should be removed from the dataset.\n",
      "Chimeras are artificial recombinants between two or more parental sequences, and they are normally formed when prematurely terminated fragments reanneal to other template DNA during PCR amplification [31].\n",
      "These artificial molecules make it difficult to differentiate the original sequence from recombinants, resulting in overestimation of the level of microbial diversity in environmental samples [32].\n",
      "Once chimeras are generated and sequenced, they need to be identified and removed from the dataset using bioinformatics tools.\n",
      "However, detecting chimeras is still challenging, as breakpoints can take place at any position more than once, and NGS platforms generate shorter lengths of sequences, making them hard to differentiate the source of parents with insufficient taxonomic information.\n",
      "Several elegant algorithms and tools have been suggested for preferentially identifying chimeric sequences in high-throughput datasets.\n",
      "These tools include UCHIME [15], ChimeraSlayer [16], Perseus [11], and Decipher [17].\n",
      "All of these tools, except for ChimeraSlayer, use sequence frequency information to detect chimeras, assuming that chimeric sequences are less frequently represented in a given dataset than normally amplified sequences.\n",
      "There is no algorithm to detect chimeras perfectly, but to date, it has been known that UCHIME outperforms other algorithms, at least for short NGS reads [15].\n",
      "Although there are still several limitations in detecting chimeric sequences that are formed by hybridization between closely related organisms, the tools listed above work well on SSUs and LSUs, but further validations are necessary for internal transcribed spacers and other functional genes.\n",
      "The next step following chimera detection is OTU clustering, which is an essential process in community analysis, as it sorts sequences with the closest matches and then gives a taxonomic meaning to the clustered group.\n",
      "Sequencing errors, chimeras, and clustering algorithms have great influence on the quality of OTUs [33].\n",
      "There are generally two ways that have been suggested for generating OTUs.\n",
      "One is alignment-based clustering, and the other is the alignment-free clustering method.\n",
      "Sequence alignment is done by either aligning query sequences against pre-aligned reference sequences [34] or using pairwise and multiple sequence alignments [35].\n",
      "It is known that alignment quality has a significant impact on OTU clustering results [36].\n",
      "Alignment quality varies, depending on gene loci and the parameters used, but sequence alignment incorporating secondary structure information generally improves OTU assignment, at least for 16S rRNA gene sequences [37].\n",
      "The nearest alignment space termination (NAST) algorithm [34] has been used successfully in microbial ecology as a profile-based alignment tool, and SINA aligner [38], based on partial order alignment, and infernal [39], using consensus RNA secondary structure profiles, were recently introduced.\n",
      "However, there is currently no method or algorithm that does automatic alignment almost perfectly or up to the quality that can be achieved manually.\n",
      "Alternatively, alignment-free methods are more broadly used in picking OTUs.\n",
      "Commonly used alignment-free tools are UCLUST [18], CD-HIT [19], and ESPRIT-Tree [20].\n",
      "UCLUST and CD-HIT implemented their own sorting processes in OTU clustering by sorting sequences in order of decreasing abundance (i.e., UCLUST) or decreasing length (i.e., CD-HIT), and ESPRIT-Tree uses an average linkage-based hierarchical clustering algorithm.\n",
      "There are some other tools that implement a 'homopolymer collapse option' for minimizing homopolymer errors in 454 reads: CLOTU [40], SCATA (http://scata.mykopat.slu.se), CrunchCluster [41], and TBC [21].\n",
      "However, these tools are currently applicable only to 454 reads, and there is a fundamental limitation of not being able to detect 'real' sequence differences appearing in homopolymer regions.\n",
      "SCATA has suggested another OTU picking approach by using both reference sequences and query sequences together in the clustering process, and then the OTU is assigned to a taxonomic identity of the reference sequence if the reference sequence belongs to the cluster.\n",
      "A taxonomy-dependent approach was recently proposed as an alternative to OTU clustering approaches [42].\n",
      "This method has two major advantages over OTU clustering.\n",
      "First, direct taxonomic assignment to each query sequence is more tolerant to sequencing errors than the OTU picking process, as the assignment process is less affected by mismatches or insertion/deletion errors, while sequencing errors are known to generate many spurious OTUs.\n",
      "It also helps prevent a massive loss of erroneous but still taxonomically meaningful sequences.\n",
      "Second, it enables researchers to perform a more standardized community analysis, based on a single assignment rule.\n",
      "There is no truly 'universal' primer set, and the difference in primer sets makes it difficult to compare datasets, as the different primer sets amplify differing variable regions within 16S rRNA genes and catch only a partial body of the whole 'true' community.\n",
      "On the other hand, a taxonomy-supervised method can circumvent the problem by directly assigning sequences to the closest relatives using full-length reference sequences.\n",
      "This approach also facilitates cross-comparison and meta-analysis across versatile microbial community studies.\n",
      "A caveat is the low taxa coverage of current marker gene databases, which offsets the advantage of this approach and hinders the application in practice by failing to find the closest matches to known members, due primarily to its lack of close relatives in a given database.\n",
      "Another limitation is the relatively lower assignment accuracy and precision of short NGS reads compared to those of full-length sequences.\n",
      "It is generally known that even longer 454 Titanium reads are able to be identifiable with high confidence scores at best to the genus level [43], even genus-level classification is doubted [44].\n",
      "However, this problem will be soon overcome as more high-quality sequences are added to the databases.\n",
      "For example, EzTaxon-e benefits from using artificially defined species names, which are defined based on combinatorial evaluation using both phylogeny and pairwise similarity between unclassified sequences on all taxonomic levels.\n",
      "It endows taxonomically more meaningful information to those 'unclassified' sequences rather than remaining unknown or environmental sequences.\n",
      "Moreover, recent updates have slightly improved the database coverage by adding error-free 454 reads that are selected using abundance information (http://eztaxon-e.ezbiocloud.net/).\n",
      "Identifying each individual sequence is of great importance in microbial community analysis, as taxonomic information gives us access to basic information of its traits, such as physiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary history, and it allows for indirect inference of their ecological roles in a given environment.\n",
      "There are several methods that have been suggested for assigning microbial taxonomy with high-throughput sequence data.\n",
      "BLAST [45] is one of the most widely used algorithms when classifying sequences.\n",
      "The top BLAST hits by searching against reference databases are generally used for taxonomic identification of query sequences.\n",
      "There are several well-curated public SSU databases, such as RDP [22], SILVA [23], Greengenes [24], and EzTaxon-e [25].\n",
      "However, the top BLAST hit does not always give the correct taxonomy result, especially in shorter reads.\n",
      "Alternatively, Greengenes and EzTaxon-e use BLAST in conjunction with global alignment, and the post processing of a BLAST-aligned output has been suggested to improve assignment accuracy using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm in MEGAN [46] and the optimal consensus method (F-measure) in TANGO [47].\n",
      "The probabilistic approach also gives a similar level of accuracy but is much faster than a BLAST search.\n",
      "The naïve Bayesian algorithm [48], implemented in RDP, uses 8-mer word-matching for training datasets and provides assignment results with bootstrapped confidence estimates.\n",
      "Phylogenetic placement method is a recently suggested approach that places query sequences into a phylogenetic guide tree on the basis of various evolutionary models.\n",
      "This approach is particularly useful in a case where there are no close relatives to the query sequence in databases, due primarily to the low DB coverage, which is the case with microbial eukaryotes.\n",
      "Tools using phylogenetic methods in taxonomic assignment include the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) [49], pplacer [50], and SEPP [51], and these algorithms were recently incorporated into QIIME [28] and AMPHORA2 [52].\n",
      "Until the arrival of NGS technologies in this field in 2006, shotgun libraries had been constructed using circular vectors, each of which had an insert derived from a metagenomic DNA fragment [53].\n",
      "Sequencing strategies designed either to completely assemble the sequence of each long-insert vector (tens to thousands of kilobases) or to generate a paired-end read from small inserts (around 1-2 kilobases) were applied to those vector libraries.\n",
      "The former strategy has a unique strength, in that it is relatively easy to generate contigs orders of magnitude longer than the read length when assembling the reads from homogeneous templates [2].\n",
      "However, such a strategy is not scalable to analyze a large number of clones, as the tremendous amount of reads per clone needs to be screened.\n",
      "The latter strategy, a genuine random shotgun approach, took essentially the same approach with the NGS-based metagenome assembly, which enables analysis of a large number of clones but requires high coverage in order to be successful [54, 55].\n",
      "Regardless of the strategies taken, vector library construction and subsequent sequencing are time-consuming and cost-ineffective, and only a few organizations can lead such efforts.\n",
      "NGS technologies have proven their utility in shotgun metagenomics since their earliest application appeared in 2006 with studies using 454 pyrosequencing data.\n",
      "After all, technologies like 454 and Illumina sequencing have become routinely applied for shotgun metagenomics, accompanying changes in the trends of the field as well as the properties of the data themselves.\n",
      "As sequencing cost continues to decrease, more researchers outside the big sequencing centers have started to participate in metagenomic studies, resulting in higher individuality and diversity of metagenome data.\n",
      "Bioinformatics for metagenome analysis has progressed, along with the explosion of data, both by extension from the tools and databases previously developed in genomics and the adoption of methodologies used by ecologists.\n",
      "Less than a decade has passed since metagenomic shotgun sequencing took its place as general practice for biologists, and it is fair to say that bioinformatics for shotgun metagenomics is at a premature stage.\n",
      "In this section, we aim to summarize the methods that seem to be the 'current' standard, the most widely used, in the analysis of shotgun metagenomic data (Fig.1).\n",
      "Assembly is the process of merging overlapped short reads into larger contiguous sequences (contigs).\n",
      "Current sequencing technologies normally break genomic DNA into pieces, and original genomic sequences need to be recovered from fragmented reads by an assembly process.\n",
      "In metagenomics for retrieving coding regions, it is necessary to make it easier to do functional annotations, as a more accurate classification/annotation is possible in longer sequence information.\n",
      "Most assemblers have been developed for the single genome or clonal populations with high coverage.\n",
      "There are currently few metagenomic assemblers, as metagenomic reads are more complex, owing to nonclonal heterogeneous reads resulting from multiple strains differing only by partial regions or rearrangements, lower or uneven coverage across genomes, sharing of repetitive sequences among closely related species, and lateral gene transfer sharing similar entities between distantly related organisms.\n",
      "At an early stage of metagenomic studies, reference mapping approaches (e.g., Newbler, AMOS, MIRA) were applied to the metagenome assembly process.\n",
      "However, with the low coverage and complexity of megenomic reads, de novo assemblers were preferred to reference mapping, based on the advantage of feasibility for dealing with the aforementioned problems.\n",
      "Starting from initial assemblers, such as SOAPdenovo [56], there are now several improved assemblers available: are Genovo [57], Meta-IDBA [58], Meta-Velvet [59], MAP [60], and Ray Meta [61].\n",
      "Metagenome-specialized assemblers have to distinguish reads from different species.\n",
      "MetaVelvet and Meta-IDBA resolve this issue by partitioning the de brujin graph based on k-mer coverage and separately assemble each subgraph.\n",
      "Ray Meta does not decompose the de brujin graph; instead, it uses a heuristics-guided graph traversal approach to find the optimal assembly.\n",
      "Meta-IDBA, MetaVelvet, and Ray Meta were developed to perform well on short reads (e.g., Illumina sequencing).\n",
      "On the other hand, other tools, like Genovo and MAP, were developed for longer reads (e.g., 454 sequencing).\n",
      "The outputs from various assemblers can be used to generate scaffolds using Bambus2 by avoiding misjoins between distantly related organisms by detecting repeats and genomic variants [62].\n",
      "Taxonomic classification of reads, which is called binning, is the most basic step in the characterization of microbial communities by metagenome sequencing.\n",
      "However, taxonomic binning of metagenome shotgun sequences is a challenging task for researchers, especially when working with short reads derived from NGS.\n",
      "There are several reasons that make binning a nontrivial job.\n",
      "One of the reasons is that NGS technologies generally produce short reads.\n",
      "When applying shotgun sequencing to complex microbial communities found in soil, seawater, freshwater, and the gastrointestinal tract, the sequencing coverage does not reach the level required to make the assembly practically useful, even by current deep sequencing methods.\n",
      "The majority of reads remains unassembled.\n",
      "As a result, the majority of reads is taxonomically classified by the information in their short length.\n",
      "Short length presents a number of drawbacks in binning.\n",
      "Homology search-based methods suffer from a lack of alignment confidence and difficulties in predicting protein sequences from partial genes.\n",
      "Phylogenetic methods suffer from a lack of resolution due to insufficient phylogenetic information.\n",
      "Another challenge is the size of data that have to be processed during the binning process.\n",
      "Data size here refers to both the reads obtained from metagenomes and the sequences in the reference database.\n",
      "The novelty of microbes in the environmental samples also hampers binning, as they are not represented by any sequence in the reference database.\n",
      "One last challenging thing for researchers is the diversity of binning tools.\n",
      "There are dozens of choices, differing in both logical and practical aspects.\n",
      "A straightforward approach for taxonomic classification of metagenome shotgun reads is searching for a similar sequence in a collection of known sequences that carries the taxonomic identity of each sequence.\n",
      "Similarity-based methods vary in at least three dimensions.\n",
      "1) Choice of reference database: the search space could be restricted to a particular marker gene (e.g., SSU rRNA for prokaryotes) or a small number of selected protein families or could be as general as the entire NCBI nr database.\n",
      "2) Search algorithm: from BLASTN (in case of using rRNA gene marker), BLASTX (protein database), and BLASTP (protein database after gene prediction) to a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based homology search (searching for protein families).\n",
      "3) Taxonomic assignment from the hit information: from simply transferring the identity of the best hit to the use of LCA, modified LCA, or more complicated phylogenetic inferences.\n",
      "Among the popularly used tools, MEGAN uses the NCBI nr database for searching and LCA algorithms for assignment [29].\n",
      "MTR and SOrt-ITEMS modified MEGAN's LCA algorithm by use of taxonomic information shared by hits (MTR) or by performing a reciprocal BLAST hit to reduce false positive hits (SOrt-ITEMS) [63, 64].\n",
      "MG-RAST exploits both rRNA gene sequences and protein-coding sequences [65].\n",
      "For the rRNA gene sequences, MG-RAST follows the RDP pipeline [22], while for protein-coding genes, it first predicts the protein coding sequences and then performs a BLASTX search against a number of databases, including SEED [66], and extracts taxonomic information from SEED hits.\n",
      "CARMA uses an algorithm similar to LCA and offers two ways for searching the database of known protein sequences: the NCBI nr database searched by BLASTX and the Pfam database searched by HMMER3 [67].\n",
      "MetaPhyler is a power-up version of AMPHORA and uses 31 marker genes to reduce the search space [68, 69].\n",
      "Composition-based classification of DNA sequences has been proven to be very useful, although it does not appear as intuitive as similarity-based methods.\n",
      "Composition-based methods exploit the uniqueness of base composition (from single to oligonucleotide levels) found across the genomes of different taxonomic entities.\n",
      "In many cases, these methods implement machine-learning algorithms.\n",
      "Ultimately, all of these methods use the taxonomic information of the reference database to assign a taxonomic identity to the reads.\n",
      "However, they can be divided into supervised and unsupervised methods, based on their dependence on the reference training set during the initial learning procedure.\n",
      "The most popular tools using supervised learning are PhyloPythia, NBC, and Phymm.\n",
      "Starting from the publicly available microbial genome sequences, NBC trains a naïve Bayes classifier based on the N-mer frequency profiles of each genome [70], Phymm builds an interpolated Markov Model using variable-length oligonucleotides typically found in taxa [71], and PhyloPythia trains a support vector machine classifier based on variable-length oligonucleotide composition [72].\n",
      "Among the above, NBC and Phymm are suitable for classifying short reads generated from NGS sequencers.\n",
      "The popular tools employing unsupervised learning are TACOA and TaxSOM.\n",
      "TACOA introduced a kernelized k-nearest neighbor approach to cluster the reads [73], while TaxSOM uses batch-learning self-organizing maps (BLSOMs) and growing SOMs (GSOMs) to generate the clusters of related reads [74].\n",
      "Both TaxSOM and TACOA are not suitable for unassembled short NGS reads.\n",
      "There are tools that combine composition-based approaches and similarity-based approaches together to gain accuracy and discard fewer reads.\n",
      "PhymmBL linearly combines the BLASTN score and Phymm score and thereby gains more power to discriminate between similar BLAST hits [71].\n",
      "RITA also combines a BLAST search with a composition-based NBC; however, unlike PhymmBL, RITA puts more weight on the BLAST result [75].\n",
      "Both approaches are reported to perform well, even with short reads, but as they involve a BLAST search, they consume much time.\n",
      "There is a third type of taxonomic binning method recently implemented in the tool MetaPhlAn, which uses clade-specific marker genes [76].\n",
      "From the database of microbial genomes, MetaPhlAn precalculated 400,141 genes that are most representative of each taxonomic unit.\n",
      "In theory, detection of the reads that match these markers can classify the members at the species level.\n",
      "MetaPhlAn uses BLASTN search to compare the reads against the set of marker genes.\n",
      "As the search space is markedly reduced from general sequence databases used in other approaches, MetaPhlAn exhibits unusually high speed.\n",
      "Functional assignments and pathway reconstructions are ultimate steps of shotgun metagenomics that allow the characterization of the functional potential of uncultivated microbes or microbial communities under investigation.\n",
      "Connecting the sequences of metagenomic data to specific functions in the environments can be performed by using web-based workflows offered by useful portals without access to high-performance computers.\n",
      "These online metagenome annotation services, like IMG/M [77], METAREP [78], CAMERA [79], and MG-RAST [80], provide platforms for gene prediction, assignment of functional categories, protein families and gene ontologies, and inference of protein interactions and metabolic pathways represented in the metagenomic data (Table 2).\n",
      "While an installable workflow like MEGAN4 [29] also exists, MEGAN4 does not provide gene predictions or homology-based or profile-based annotation analyses.\n",
      "Instead, the pipeline uses ready-made annotation data derived from BLASTX or BLASTP against the NCBI nr database.\n",
      "Gene finding or gene prediction is a fundamental step for annotation.\n",
      "Classical gene finders that have been developed for a single genome are unsuitable for metagenomic analysis, because metagenome data are made up of a mixture of sequences from different organisms and often comprise mainly short assemblies and unassembled reads.\n",
      "Moreover, the high error rate of NGS can lead to frameshifts and make gene prediction more difficult.\n",
      "For this reason, several dedicated gene prediction programs have been developed, like Meta-Gene [81], MetaGeneAnnotator [82], Orphelia [83], FragGeneScan [84], Glimmer-MG [85], and MetaGenemark [86].\n",
      "These programs incorporate different models for gene prediction, such as machine learning algorithms [87], HMMs [88], and di-codon usages [89].\n",
      "MetaGeneMark (GeneMark) uses codon usage-incorporated HMM; Prodigal incorporates a machine learning algorithm [90]; MetaGene incorporates di-codon usage [91]; FragGeneScan uses a sequencing error model and codon usage-incorporated HMM; MetaGeneAnnotator uses a machine learning algorithm and di-codon usage information; Glimmer-MG uses an interpolated Markov model [92]; and Orphelia uses a codon usage-incorporated machine learning algorithm.\n",
      "Functional analysis of metagenome generally uses a homology-based approach and involves a BLAST [45] search against a database, integrating several individual databases curated for specific analysis [93].\n",
      "For functional category annotation, COGs [94] and eggnogs [95] databases are used.\n",
      "COGs, one of the widely used gene categories, was constructed from 66 genomes.\n",
      "Because COGs has a relatively small size of functional categories appropriate for determining well-known genes and because the database has not been updated for a long time, COGs shows low sensitivity for recently discovered genes.\n",
      "eggNOGs, created in 2011 and used by the portal service MG-RAST, shows higher sensitivity than COGs, because it is constructed based on the pre-annotation of orthologous groups from 1,133 genomes using COGs and KOGs.\n",
      "A BLAST-based approach is still widely used in functional category annotation, but it is hampered by its computational complexity and lack of homologous sequences in reference databases [93].\n",
      "For a protein family analysis, the resources in the Pfam [96] and TIGRfam [97] databases are applied through the use of a HMM-based algorithm, profile (HMM profile), and search tool (HMMER; [98]).\n",
      "Similarity search results are transferred to annotations, based on the best hit's information.\n",
      "The Pfam and TIGRfam databases are resources consisting of curated multiple alignments and HMMs generated from the Sanger Institute and J. Craig Venter Institute, respectively.\n",
      "A previous study reported that more protein family predictions were available using Pfam, because the Pfam database contains a higher number of protein families (14,831 protein families in Pfam 27.0 release) than TIGRfam database (4,284 protein families in TIGRfam 13.0 release) [93].\n",
      "While IGM/M, METAREP, and CAMERA use HMM-based databases, such as Pfam and TIGRfam, MG-RAST uses an HMM-independent database, namely FIGfams [99].\n",
      "FIGfams are sets of protein sequences and alignments that are similar along their full length and are believed to implement the same function generated from National Microbial Pathogen Data Resource (NMPDR).\n",
      "Gene ontology is assigned using the gene ontology (GO) database in most publically available pipelines.\n",
      "GO analysis was available in version 3 of MEGAN, but it was replaced by two functional methods, based on the SEED classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) in MEGAN4.\n",
      "In addition to protein family analysis, MG-RAST offers information on putative protein-protein interactions by applying EMBL's Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) tool [100].\n",
      "Metabolic pathway reconstruction is generally performed using the KEGG database [101].\n",
      "While IMG/M, CAMERA, and MG-RAST use the KEGG database and KEGG graphs, METAREP uses PRIAM [102].\n",
      "PRIAM is a method for automated enzyme detection, based on the available ENZYME database [103], and provides KEGG graphs for visualization.\n",
      "Other pathway databases and tools, like MetaCyc [104] and MetaPath [105], are also used to annotate functional roles for metagenomic data but have not yet been integrated into online portal services for metagenomic analysis.\n",
      "An alternative to the methods mentioned above for inferring metabolic pathways is 'subsystem' in SEED [66].\n",
      "Subsystems represent the collection of functional roles that constitute similar or related forms of complex structural and metabolic pathways, such as glyoxylate bypass, sulfur oxidation, and ribosomal protein paralogs.\n",
      "The subsystem annotation based on SEED is currently implemented in IMG/M, MG-RAST, and MEGAN4.\n",
      "Early metagenomic studies focused mainly on investigating less complex ecosystems and specific targets in a given environment due to high sequencing costs, ecosystem complexity, and lack of high-performance computing and bioinformatics tools.\n",
      "Much work has been done on testing new molecular techniques and tools and discovering novel enzymes and taxonomic lineages rather than testing many scientific hypotheses.\n",
      "This is why many previous and even current studies are not sufficiently replicated in experimental design.\n",
      "Of course, it is possible to compare the difference between metagenomic studies, which are not replicated [106].\n",
      "However, it enables us to obtain statistically meaningful and biologically more relevant conclusions if larger sample sizes with more replicates are provided at a deeper layer of the sequencing regimen.\n",
      "For inferring statistically meaningful differences between metagenome samples and exploring metabolic/taxonomic diversity in a given sample, metadata should be provided and standardized according to a proper rule.\n",
      "More standardized formats for describing marker genes, genomes, and metagenome datasets were recently suggested in minimum information about any (x) sequence checklists (MIxS) [107].\n",
      "This standardized format makes it possible to do many statistical analyses and meta-analyses across metagenomic studies by providing more standardized contextual information about the environment sampled as well as experimental and sequencing information.\n",
      "Centralizing contextual information will become more common in future metagenomic studies.\n",
      "Aside from experimental design and contextual data, metagenomic data have inherent limitations that must be overcome in the future.\n",
      "Metagenomic reads commonly show a relatively low genomic coverage compared to that of a single genome, and the short length of sequencing reads makes only fragmented information by the incomplete assembly and annotation processes accessible.\n",
      "Initiatives are already under way for filling the gap between metagenomic reads by doing co-assembly with single-cell genomics [108] and joint analysis between multiple metagenomes simultaneously [109], on the assumption that the same species must exist in different samples and that the co-occurrence helps extract shared information.\n",
      "The ultimate goal of metagenomics is a comprehensive understanding of our ecosystem.\n",
      "In the near future, metagenomics will be one of the essential parts of viewing our ecosystem through integration with other '-omics' approaches such as metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics.\n",
      "Over the last few years, metagenomics has accelerated the understanding of microbial ecology and evolution, thanks to the technical advances of sequencing platforms.\n",
      "Metagenomics itself is not a panacea that is able to answer all unresolved questions and uncover the 'dark matter' of our knowledge in microbial diversity and function studies, but it is undoubtedly an excellent tool, giving insight into completing the jigsaw puzzles of our understanding of the surrounding biosphere by exploring both 'who is out there' and 'what they do' in nature.\n",
      "It is true that studying metagenomics is still recognized by ordinary microbial ecologists as a tool that is difficult to tackle due to its complexity and the enormous amount of sequence data that needs to be dealt with.\n",
      "However, it is not surprising that we will witness 'doing metagenomics' in the future as if we routinely do PCR and gel electrophoresis in our laboratory.\n",
      "Current development of tools and databases for metagenomic studies is in its infancy, and there are still many challenges to overcome.\n",

      "\n",
      "The microbial diversity in soil ecosystems is higher than in any other microbial ecosystem.\n",
      "The majority of soil microorganisms has not been characterized, because the dominant members have not been readily culturable on standard cultivation media; therefore, the soil ecosystem is a great reservoir for the discovery of novel microbial enzymes and bioactivities.\n",
      "The soil metagenome, the collective microbial genome, could be cloned and sequenced directly from soils to search for novel microbial resources.\n",
      "This review summarizes the microbial diversity in soils and the efforts to search for microbial resources from the soil metagenome, with more emphasis on the potential of bioprospecting metagenomics and recent discoveries.\n",
      "In 1898, a microbiologist, Heinrich Winterberg, first described that there was a discrepancy in the number of microorganisms between culturable bacteria on nutrient media and the total bacteria in nature counted by microscopy.\n",
      "Since then, microbial unculturability, the so-called 'great plate count anomaly,' has long been recognized in microbiology [1].\n",
      "While microbial unculturability is not fully understood so far, microbial diversity has been analyzed extensively in various environments.\n",
      "This was mostly due to the advance of a molecular microbial ecology.\n",
      "The development of culture-independent analysis adopted amplification and DNA sequencing of microbial signature rRNA sequences from nature without cultivation of entire microbial species [2].\n",
      "Therefore, analysis of the microbial phylogenetic marker genes, such as the 16S rRNA gene, revealed that microorganisms are the true dominant organism in nature [3].\n",
      "The number of prokaryotic cells was estimated to be 4-6 × 1030 cells on Earth, and the prokaryotes represent the largest pool of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus among living organisms [4].\n",
      "Microbial diversity has also been recognized from various soils, and only a small fraction of total microbial species in soil (i.e., less than 1%) has been characterized by cultivation-based methods [5, 6].\n",
      "Since the majority of unculturable bacteria in soil has not been cultured [7], it has not been functionally characterized.\n",
      "The microbial diversity in soil is probably highest compared to other microbial communities.\n",
      "Culture-independent analysis of microbial diversity in soil revealed that most bacterial members abundant in soils are members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacterium, Firmicutes, and some Verrucomicrobia [8, 9], showing that a large number of the 16S rRNA gene clones originated from uncultured bacterial species.\n",
      "The abundance of the members was somewhat variable in different types of soil.\n",
      "For example, the forest soils retained higher members of the phylum Acidobacteria but fewer β-proteobacterial members [10].\n",
      "On the other hand, agricultural soils harbor higher numbers of members in β-proteobacteria but less Acidobacteria.\n",
      "The interesting result recently reported by Mendes et al.\n",
      "[11] indicated that the relative abundance of bacterial phyla, not their profiles, could be important for microbial community function in a specific soil, such as disease-suppressive soil.\n",
      "The metagenome is the total microbial genome isolated directly from microorganisms in nature.\n",
      "The first proposal of the term 'metagenome' was by Handelsman et al.\n",
      "[12], while the first approach using environmental DNA was reported in 1995 to search for genes encoding cellulases [13].\n",
      "The soil metagenome can be isolated directly from various types of soil either directly or indirectly without bacterial cultivation [14-16].\n",
      "While the microbial diversities of various microbial habitats are being actively investigated by taking advantage of next-generation sequencing technology to analyze a large number of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences derived from a variety of soils [8], the advances in bioprospecting metagenomics are relatively slow.\n",
      "As a bioprospecting purpose, the purified soil metagenomic DNA would be cloned into several different plasmid vectors.\n",
      "In general, high-molecular-weight DNAs cloned into fosmid, cosmid, or bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors are introduced into a surrogate host bacterium, such as Escherichia coli [17].\n",
      "Especially, the fosmid-based preparation of a metagenomic library is the most frequently used strategy, due to their high cloning efficiency, the improved stability in E. coli, and the feasibility to construct a medium-sized (40 kb)-insert DNA library [18].\n",
      "Considering the low frequency of finding genes for novel bioactivities from a soil metagenomic library [19], the cloning efficiency is a crucial factor to construct a large clone member library.\n",
      "One of the most critical steps for successful library construction is the isolation of pure high-molecular-weight DNA, which is suitable for cloning into the vectors [8, 20].\n",
      "However, high contents of soil-derived humic acids are co-purified during the high-molecular-weight DNA isolation process, and humic acids interfere with the cloning process of high-molecular-weight DNA into a vector.\n",
      "Various methods to remove humic acids during soil metagenomic DNA purification usually end up with the recovery of relatively low-molecular-weight DNA, which is not suitable to clone into a fosmid or BAC.\n",
      "Several commercial kits would be plausible to purify soil metagenomic DNA for the amplification purpose of 16S rRNA genes, which will be subsequently used for microbial diversity analysis.\n",
      "However, the sizes of DNA fragments isolated by most of the commercial kits are rather small to clone into vectors, such as fosmids and BACs.\n",
      "Therefore, optimal methods for the direct isolation of high-molecular-weight DNA from soil have been developed and used for bioprospecting metagenomics [14, 16, 20].\n",
      "Although obtaining a large number of metagenomic clones from soil is a prerequisite to search for novel microbial genes from soil, the technologies for metagenomic library construction were generalized using fosmids and cosmids.\n",
      "Various novel microbial resources could be expected from soil metagenomic libraries, because soils bear the highest microbial diversity compared to any other microbial community.\n",
      "Title: Tapping soil metagenome\n",
      "\n",
      "Since functional metagenomics (or bioprospecting metagenomics) was attempted from a soil ecosystem [17], a number of microbial genes encoding novel enzymes or bioactive compounds have been identified and characterized [21, 22].\n",
      "Here, we summarize several technical points to be considered for bioprospecting metagenomics and the major results of novel enzymes and bioactivities from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "Title: Screening strategies and high-throughput screening (HTS)\n",
      "\n",
      "Metagenomic libraries with either large-insert DNA or small-insert DNA were used to search for novel microbial genes.\n",
      "The library with the small-insert DNA could be feasible to identify novel enzymes, while that with the large-insert DNA is also frequently used [23].\n",
      "Screening of both types of metagenomic libraries has been conducted and successfully identified many novel enzymes and bioactivities [21].\n",
      "Two different approaches for screening the metagenomic libraries are frequently used, such as function-based (expression-dependent) screening and sequence-based (homology-dependent) screening.\n",
      "Function-based screening is dependent on the expression of metagenomic genes in a surrogate host, such as E. coli, and subsequently detects metabolic activities in the heterologous host.\n",
      "Therefore, the proper expression of metagenomic genes is essential to detect the phenotypic characteristics of the desired activity by the function-based screening approach.\n",
      "It is arguable that the majority of genes from uncultured soil microorganisms would not be expressed properly in a host bacterium.\n",
      "There has been no extensive analysis to assess the expression ratio of metagenomic genes in defined culturable bacteria.\n",
      "In spite of the expression barrier of cloned metagenomic genes in E. coli, the function-driven approach has proven to be feasible to search for novel genes and gene products [22].\n",
      "Recently, function-based screening approaches have been advanced and modified to search for novel microbial genes compared with the original approach-i.e., the direct detection of metabolic function [17].\n",
      "Host strains or mutants were used to identify genes for functional complementation in trans by metagenomic clones [24], and another advance in function-based screening was combined with HTS to detect the induced gene expression in a host bacterium with substrates, autoinducers, and metabolic products provided exogenously [25-27].\n",
      "One of the approaches to overcome the host expression barrier is to develop a broad-host range vector to express a metagenomic library in a variety of host bacteria.\n",
      "This approach, in fact, is promising and nourishing the function-based screening of metagenomics to obtain diverse microbial resources for enzymes and biomolecules [28].\n",
      "The sequence-based approach is to screen for marker genes using DNA probe or PCR primers designed from DNA sequences of already known genes.\n",
      "Since this approach would detect gene variants with the conserved motif from the metagenome, it is arguable if this approach would really screen true novel genes from microbial diversity.\n",
      "Nevertheless, there are a number of examples with some successful identification of novel microbial enzymes [22, 29].\n",
      "A recent approach with sequence-based screening is taking advantage of the advances in next-generation sequencing.\n",
      "Direct sequencing of metagenomic DNA by next-generation sequencing is now used increasingly to study gene inventories in the metagenomes of specific microbial communities [30].\n",
      "Direct sequencing of a metagenome generates a large dataset, which should be analyzed by support of the appropriate informatics.\n",
      "Analysis of the soil metagenome by the sequencing-based approach is still a huge challenge, since the soil microbial community is the most complicated one with the highest microbial diversity compared with any other microbial community.\n",
      "A combination of appropriate bioinformatics, such as comparative sequence analysis, with the large set of soil metagenome sequences will be a new opportunity to search for microbial enzymes and novel bioactivities in the future [31].\n",
      "HTS is another issue for bioprospecting metagenomics with the direct sequencing of the metagenome.\n",
      "If both function-based and sequence-based screening is combined with HTS, novel microbial enzymes and bioactivities would be detected at higher frequency compared with conventional screening.\n",
      "This is mainly because the large numbers of metagenomic clones in libraries should be searched for novel enzymes and biomolecules to tap the great soil microbial diversity.\n",
      "Some of the recently adopted HTS methods for drug discovery may enable the discovery of novel enzymes and biomolecules from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "Multidisciplinary efforts, combined with bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and high-throughput technology, is required to search for novel enzymes and bioactivities from soil metagenomes.\n",
      "Title: Novel enzymes from soil metagenome\n",
      "\n",
      "Many novel enzymes were identified from various metagenomic studies, and we summarized the examples of enzyme recovery from soil metagenome studies in Table 1 [10, 32-58].\n",
      "One of the most prevailing novel enzymes found from the soil metagenome is esterase/lipase.\n",
      "Lipolytic enzymes, such as esterases and lipases, are important biocatalysts for biotechnological applications.\n",
      "The interesting features of lipolytic enzymes include no requirement for cofactors, remarkable stability in organic solvents, broad substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and positional selectivity [23].\n",
      "The features of lipolytic enzymes are especially attractive for organic synthesis if the enzymes with specific chiral resolution could be retrieved from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "Therefore, the discovery of novel lipolytic enzymes from the soil metagenome has received much attention compared to other enzymes.\n",
      "Considering that lipolytic enzymes are the most well characterized and highly studied enzymes among biocatalysts, the finding of several novel families of esterase/lipase enzymes is quite surprising.\n",
      "One of our previous results with EstD2 revealed that EstD2 was not similar to any previously described enzymes, while the enzyme clearly displayed esterase activity [39].\n",
      "A similar protein found in the GenBank database also exhibited the same activity, while it was initially annotated as a hypothetical protein.\n",
      "Therefore, function-driven selection of EstD2 constituted a novel family of esterases and re-annotated many proteins as esterase/lipases that were previously known as hypothetical proteins.\n",
      "Similar studies with enzymes found in the soil metagenome suggested that soil microbial diversity truly bears the great extent of novel microbial enzymes.\n",
      "Cellulolytic enzymes and cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) of plant cells are also enzymes with biotechnological interest, mostly due to biomass degradation, with the purpose of bioenergy production.\n",
      "In contrast to the enzymatic interest, the identification of novel cellulolytic enzymes or other CWDEs is not well documented.\n",
      "The reason for the rare recovery of cellulases and CWDEs is poor secretion of these enzymes in E. coli, the major host bacteria, and incompatible detection methods of enzymatic activity for a large member of metagenomic libraries from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "For the successful detection of cellulases and CWDEs, technical elaboration with HTS would be necessary to enhance the detection of proper enzyme activity.\n",
      "Bioinformatics, such as comparative sequence analysis of the metagenome, could be another choice to identify cellulolytic enzymes and CWDEs from massive datasets derived from direct sequencing of the soil metagenome.\n",
      "A number of enzymes for other carbohydrate metabolism and a few lactonases were also detected from the soil metagenome, and they are listed in Table 1.\n",
      "However, many enzymes are not feasible to detection by simply screening for the bacterial phenotypic changes, while the lipolytic enzymes were simply identified by tributyrin hydrolysis on culture medium.\n",
      "Title: Bioactivities from soil metagenome\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the novel enzymes, soil metagenomes are rich sources of a variety of small molecules with bioactivities, such as antibiotics and other pharmaceutically applicable activities.\n",
      "The search for novel bioactivities is primarily based on the phenotypic detection of bacterial traits of the host bacteria bearing metagenomic libraries.\n",
      "Antagonistic activity and colony color changes of the host bacterium are typical examples to detect metagenomic clones, potentially associated with novel secondary metabolite production.\n",
      "However, the conventional approach exhibits a rarer chance to identify novel gene clusters and bioactivities [19].\n",
      "Therefore, it is necessary to develop new detection strategies for novel bioactivities from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "Nonetheless, the simple detection of antibiosis or color changes of the host bacterial colonies with metagenomic clones brought some interesting results, suggesting the great potential of novel bioactivities from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "We summarize the identified bioactivities and their gene clusters from the soil metagenome in Table 2.\n",
      "These bioactivities include antibacterial turbomycins, glycopeptides, cyanobactins, type II polyketides, trans-acyltransferase polyketides, and the anticancer agent ET-743 [21].\n",
      "Some of the bioactivities from the soil metagenome may also be discovered by homology-based screening.\n",
      "Whole metagenome sequences from soil, which will be accomplished in the future, would be a rich source to be probed to identify gene clusters for bioactive compound production.\n",
      "The soil metagenome, a rich microbial source, is still unexplored, since major microbial species have not been cultured and characterized from various soils.\n",
      "Both function-driven metagenomics and homology-dependent metagenomics have started out in soils and brought some successful discovery of novel microbial enzymes and secondary metabolites.\n",
      "Further analysis of soil microbial communities and the appropriate enrichment of target resources from soils will increase the chance to discover novel microbial enzymes and bioactivities from the soil metagenome.\n",
      "In addition, the adoption of HTS, the advances in sequencing technology, and the proper bioinformatics would be necessary to improve the efficacy of bioprospecting metagenomics of soils for the discovery of novel enzymes and bioactivities.\n",

      "\n",
      "The introduction of metagenomics into the field of virology has facilitated the exploration of viral communities in various natural habitats.\n",
      "Understanding the viral ecology of a variety of sample types throughout the biosphere is important per se, but it also has potential applications in clinical and diagnostic virology.\n",
      "However, the procedures used by viral metagenomics may produce technical errors, such as amplification bias, while public viral databases are very limited, which may hamper the determination of the viral diversity in samples.\n",
      "This review considers the current state of viral metagenomics, based on examples from Korean viral metagenomic studies-i.e., rice paddy soil, fermented foods, human gut, seawater, and the near-surface atmosphere.\n",
      "Viral metagenomics has become widespread due to various methodological developments, and much attention has been focused on studies that consider the intrinsic role of viruses that interact with their hosts.\n",
      "Viruses are the most abundant and diverse biological entities in the biosphere, and their global numbers have been estimated at 1.2 × 1030 and 2.6 × 1030 in the ocean and soil, respectively [1].\n",
      "Thus, viruses are key elements that contribute to the life cycles of cellular organisms [2].\n",
      "However, the study of viral ecology in natural habitats has been limited due to the difficulties of viral culture [3].\n",
      "The lack of a ubiquitous marker gene, such as the 16S rRNA gene shared by all bacteria and archaea, also hampered our understanding of the genetic diversity of viruses, prior to the introduction of metagenomics into the field of viral ecology [1, 4].\n",
      "Recently, viral metagenomics has enabled researchers to explore the community structure and diversity of viruses in various natural ecosystems [5].\n",
      "This methodology depends on a priori knowledge of the viral types that may be present [6, 7].\n",
      "The first viral metagenome of uncultured marine viral communities was published in 2002 [8], and there have been many subsequent advances in the methodologies (e.g., methods for amplifying the initial viral genomes) and tools used for bioinformatics analysis in viral metagenomics.\n",
      "These technical developments have facilitated explorations of the abundance and diversity of viruses from a wide range of natural habitats in Korea.\n",
      "In Korea, viral metagenomics was applied for the first time to unique samples, including fermented foods and atmospheric samples, as well as habitats where viruses are expected to have significant roles, such as rice paddy soil, seawater, and the human gut.\n",
      "This review describes recent advances in viral metagenomics and provides summaries of studies that have been conducted to characterize Korean viral metagenomes.\n",
      "In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the most widely used viral DNA amplification methods are discussed, based on empirical knowledge.\n",
      "Further directions for the study of virus-host interactions are also highlighted.\n",
      "Viral metagenomics is the study of viral metagenomes (known as viromes), which are obtained directly from environmental samples using viral particle purification and shotgun sequencing.\n",
      "Viral metagenomic studies have increased gradually since the expansion of metagenomic approaches to viral ecology; i.e., over 200 (61 reviews) investigations of the viral communities in environmental samples have been published (Fig.1) [8-13].\n",
      "In 2002, Breitbart et al.\n",
      "[8] used shotgun library sequencing and reported that the majority of the sequences in marine viral metagenomes shared no similarity with any genes in public databases, which suggested that most environmental viruses remained uncharacterized.\n",
      "This was the first study using viral metagenomic approaches in the field.\n",
      "Subsequently, many studies have surveyed the viral diversity of unexplored habitats using viral metagenomics.\n",
      "Cultivation in a host is usually necessary to obtain a virus from the environment that is being investigated.\n",
      "However, the application of metagenomics techniques based on genetic information can circumvent this obstacle [14].\n",
      "Based on the physical characteristics of virions, viral particles can be isolated from environmental samples, which are enriched using a combination of size filtration (e.g., <0.22 µm) and density gradient centrifugation (e.g., 1.35-1.5 g/mL cesium chloride) [14], so that the virome can be obtained from the purified viral particles.\n",
      "There is a lack of evolutionarily conserved genes, such as the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA gene, in viral genomes.\n",
      "Therefore, the fragmented viral metagenomic sequences obtained by whole-genome shotgun DNA sequencing are used to analyze the viral ecology instead.\n",
      "Viral genomes are small (on average, they comprise a few to several dozen kilobases); so, valuable genome coverage can be achieved easily by DNA sequencing.\n",
      "The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina sequencing, makes it easier to achieve suitable genome coverage at low cost.\n",
      "Indeed, over 90 of either nearly complete or complete novel viral genomes were assembled using these methods in recent studies [9, 10, 15-20].\n",
      "However, it is inevitable that an amplification step is necessary for small viral genomes prior to DNA sequencing.\n",
      "Linker amplified shotgun library (LASL) and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) are the main methods used to amplify viromes in viral metagenomics.\n",
      "The LASL method, developed by Breitbart et al.\n",
      "[8], PCR-amplifies a virome after adapter attachment to randomly fragmented viral DNAs.\n",
      "The application of adapter attachment is restricted to double-stranded DNA sequences; so, only double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses can be detected using the LASL method.\n",
      "Thus, the dominance of dsDNA tailed bacteriophages was reported initially in uncultured marine viral assemblages [8], as well as other environmental samples, such as kimchi [11], aquatic water [8], and feces [21].\n",
      "The MDA technique [22] amplifies DNA isothermally using the phi29 polymerase and random hexaprimers and has been used before in microbiology [22].\n",
      "The high amplification efficiency of this method means that it is suitable for amplification during viral metagenomics applications.\n",
      "Particularly, the phi29 polymerase of the MDA technique selectively amplifies circular genomes (estimated at 100 times) [10], and it has facilitated the discovery of abundant single-stranded DNA and RNA viruses in environmental samples [23, 24] (described in detail below).\n",
      "The analysis of viral metagenome data using bioinformatics is one of the most challenging aspects of viral metagenomics.\n",
      "One million to 1 billion reads of viral metagenomic sequences are typically generated by high-throughput sequencing platforms (with an average read length of 350-400 bp using 454 GS-FLX Titanium and 2 × 150 bp using Illumina HiSeq 2500).\n",
      "After removing any low-quality, redundant, and chimeric sequences, the viral sequences are compared to sequences in public databases (e.g., the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide database, MG-RAST, and CAMERA) using BLAST [25] or USEARCH [26].\n",
      "The identification of viral sequences based on significant amino acid similarity (E-value of <10-3) was first described by Breitbart et al.\n",
      "[8], and it has since been extended to the exploration of environmental viromes, although the E-score applied to viral metagenomic studies appears to be regarded as \"a loose standard\" [27].\n",
      "Most of the environmental viromes detected by viral metagenomics are defined as orphan (unassigned) sequences.\n",
      "The majority of viral sequences shares no amino acid similarity with previously observed genes (average 40% to 50%, occasionally up to 90%, of sequences); so, they are characterized as \"unknown\" [5].\n",
      "Comparisons of viral sequences with the data in public databases have demonstrated that little is known about environmental viruses.\n",
      "Thus, the majority of the unassigned sequences in viral metagenomes is often regarded as \"junk sequences\" due to a lack of suitable bioinformatics tools and viral databases for their characterization [1, 28].\n",
      "At present, the viral databases are biased toward animal and plant viruses, although viruses that infect prokaryotes (bacteriophages) are sparsely represented.\n",
      "Most of the latter are restricted to phages that infect bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria [29, 30].\n",
      "Moreover, even \"known\" viral sequences share low amino acid similarities (<50%) with viral protein sequences [9, 11, 13, 31]; so, the majority of environmental viruses representing novel viral species and their viral diversity is much greater than considered previously.\n",
      "The observation of a high percentage of ORFans (open reading frames with no homologs in known genes in the databases) in viral genomes [32] also supports the novelty of environmental viromes.\n",
      "Thus, researchers could discover novel viruses in orphan sequence pools that currently remain \"untapped resources.\"\n",
      "These findings indicate our current lack of knowledge about viral genetic information and emphasize the need for physiological studies of viruses to understand viral ecology based on genomic data.\n",
      "Using viral metagenomic approaches, viral diversity and abundance have been investigated in various natural ecosystems in Korea, including rice paddy soil, fermented foods, the human gut, seawater, and the near-surface atmosphere (Table 1).\n",
      "The morphologies of environmental viruses have been imaged using transmission electron microscopy (Fig.2).\n",
      "Sipho- and podo-like tailed viruses were found in fermented foods (Fig.2A-2C), while non-tailed small viruses were detected in the near-surface atmosphere (Fig.2G-2I).\n",
      "Various types of tailed, non-tailed, circular, and long linear viruses were found in the human gut (Fig.2D-2F).\n",
      "In general, the virions ranged in size from 30 to 60 nm.\n",
      "In agreement with the results of previous viral metagenomic studies [23, 31], over half of the sequences in the Korean environmental viromes were described as orphan sequences, based on comparisons with viral proteins in public databases (Table 1).\n",
      "Most of the sequences identified were assigned to the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae families of dsDNA viruses and the Circoviridae, Germiniviridae, Nanoviridae, and Microviridae families of ssDNA viruses (Fig.3).\n",
      "The first viral metagenomic study in Korea surveyed uncultured viral assemblages in rice paddy soil in 2008 [10], where MDA was used with phi29 DNA poly merase and random hexaprimers to amplify viral DNA and to construct clone libraries for metagenome sequencing.\n",
      "The soil was found to contain a rich pool of unknown ssDNA viruses and dsDNA viruses.\n",
      "This study also focused on the effect of MDA amplification on different types of genomic DNA and showed that MDA preferentially amplified circular DNA genomes.\n",
      "This was also demonstrated using an environmental sample from surface seawater [12], where dsDNA viruses alone were retrieved in the LASL library, whereas ssDNA viruses were overwhelmingly represented in the MDA library.\n",
      "Thus, the amplification methods used in viral metagenomics can affect the ratios of viral sequences greatly and lead to inaccurate estimates of viral diversity.\n",
      "Next, Park et al.\n",
      "[11] investigated the abundance and diversity of uncultured viral assemblages in fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut-fermented foods that have been consumed for a long time around the world.\n",
      "In contrast to the soil virome, dsDNA bacteriophages from the families Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae dominated the fermented foods, and they contained a low complexity of viral assemblages compared with other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.\n",
      "However, it is possible that the viral diversity of the viromes detected in fermented foods may have been constrained to dsDNA viruses by the LASL method.\n",
      "A large number of unknown microbes, such as bacteria, archaea, microbial eukarya, and viruses, constitute up to 1012 bacteria per gram of feces in the human gastrointestinal tract [33], and it is expected that gut viruses will affect the relationships among viruses, bacteria, and gut epithelial cells [34].\n",
      "Kim et al.\n",
      "[13] investigated the abundance and diversity of DNA viruses in fecal samples from five healthy Koreans, particularly ssDNA viruses.\n",
      "Using epifluorescence microscopy with SYBR Gold staining [35], the viral abundance ranged from 108 to 109 per gram of feces, which was 10-fold less than the bacterial abundance in many other environments that harbored 10-100-fold more viruses (e.g., aquatic environments).\n",
      "Moreover, the diversity of gut viral assemblages was lower than that of gut bacteria.\n",
      "These results support Reyes et al.\n",
      "[29], who found that viral-microbial interactions in the human intestine could not be described as a predator-prey relationship, and instead, it was referred to as \"kill the winner,\" which was driven by a lytic life cycle.\n",
      "Airborne viruses are now regarded as major environmental risk factors for complex disease pathogenesis [36-38].\n",
      "However, the atmosphere remains \"one of the last frontiers of biological exploration on Earth\" [9].\n",
      "Using viral metagenomics with an advanced airborne particle sampling system, Whon et al.\n",
      "[9] conducted the first study of the diversity and community composition of airborne viruses in the near-surface atmosphere.\n",
      "The viral abundance in the atmosphere exhibited seasonal changes (increasing from autumn to winter before decreasing until spring) in the range of 106 to 107 viruses per m3, and the temporal variations in viral abundance were inversely correlated with seasonal changes in temperature and absolute humidity.\n",
      "Plant-associated ssDNA geminivirus-related viruses and animal-infecting circoviruses dominated the viral assemblages, with low numbers of nanoviruses and microphages in air viromes, which suggests that airborne viral assemblages are affected greatly by terrestrial plants and animal activities.\n",
      "The compositions of viral assemblages are determined by how the virome is amplified.\n",
      "Thus, the compositions of the viral assemblages detected in fermented foods and marine samples are biased toward dsDNA viruses, such as sipho-, podo-, and myophages, when the LASL method is used, whereas the viral assemblages detected in rice paddy soil, human gut, marine, and near-surface atmosphere samples contain high proportions of ssDNA viral sequences, due to the use of MDA, as shown in Fig.3.\n",
      "In addition, the compositions of the viral assemblages characterized in Korean environments tend to depend on their specific microbial features.\n",
      "The human gastrointestinal tract and fermented foods are exposed to massive numbers of gut bacteria and lactic acid bacteria, respectively [39-41].\n",
      "By contrast, the atmosphere contains far less cellular metabolism and reproductive activity than other environments, such as the soil, seawater, fermented foods, and the human gut [42].\n",
      "On this basis, the lowest abundance of eukaryotic viruses was observed in the viral assemblages in the human gut and fermented foods, whereas a high abundance of eukaryotic viruses was detected in the near-surface atmosphere.\n",
      "High levels of prokaryote and eukaryote cells are present in rice paddy soil [43] and seawater [44], and so, comparable amounts of bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses were detected in their viromes.\n",
      "The development of viral metagenomics has facilitated the discovery of novel, previously undescribed viral species.\n",
      "An artifact of the MDA method is that it selectively amplifies the circular genomes of ssDNA viruses, so that a large number of ssDNA viral sequences have been identified in environmental viromes.\n",
      "Thus, there is great interest in the distribution and host range of ssDNA viruses.\n",
      "In particular, microphages from the family Microviridae have been identified in a wide range of environments [13, 45, 46].\n",
      "In contrast to the ecology of marine dsDNA phages, marine ssDNA phages in the family Microviridae have distinct spatial and temporal distributions [45].\n",
      "ssDNA microphages were abundant in the healthy human gut and their genotypes were much more diverse than those reported previously [13].\n",
      "Moreover, prophage-like elements in the genomes of gut microbes, such as Bacteroides and Prevotella spp., were characterized as a novel subgroup in the family Microviridae [13, 47], while viral sequences from the human gut were clustered with prophage-like elements from Bacteroides and Prevotella spp.[13].\n",
      "This suggests that Bacteroides and Prevotella spp.are included within the host range of the ssDNA microphages in the human gut [47].\n",
      "Eukaryotic ssDNA viruses that infect plants and mammals have been identified in many environmental viromes.\n",
      "Circoviruses that are known to infect birds and pigs have also been identified in the viromes of invertebrates and a fish [48, 49], while geminiviruses that cause plant diseases have been detected in whiteflies, which act as insect vectors of plant viruses [50].\n",
      "A recent study by Whon et al.\n",
      "[9] investigated airborne DNA viral assemblages in near-surface atmosphere samples and showed that a high number of viruses (log 6 to 7 viruses per m3) were present in the air, which were dominated by geminivirus-related viruses.\n",
      "These viruses were identified as plant fungal pathogen-infecting mycoviruses-i.e., Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence-associated DNA virus 1-which indicates that the airborne viral assemblages in the near-surface atmosphere may have strong interactions with plants.\n",
      "These results highlight the extensive distribution of ssDNA viruses in a wide range of environments, and their host ranges may be wider than previously recognized.\n",
      "Thus, the discovery of novel genomes of ssDNA viral families in metagenomic studies could revolutionize our knowledge of the ecology and evolution of ssDNA viruses.\n",
      "In the last decade, viral ecologists have focused on community-level analyses of viruses to understand their abundance and genetic diversity in specific environments.\n",
      "The ecological effects of viruses, particularly bacteriophages, are known to control host populations via the \"kill the winner system,\" while they drive mortality and evolutionary change in microorganisms via lateral gene transfer by infecting their host bacteria, although the basic issue of \"who infects whom\" is poorly understood [2, 29, 51, 52].\n",
      "In the ocean, for example, viruses regulate the microbial abundance, release dissolved organic matter, and affect global biogeochemical cycles by killing up to 40% of host bacteria per day [53, 54].\n",
      "In contrast, symbiotic functions of viruses, such as host survival, competition, and protection from pathogenic infections, are beginning to be understood [55], and evidence for a beneficial interaction in phage-host interactions was found in the mammalian gut ecosystem [29, 56].\n",
      "When host survival is threatened, a variety of environmental factors can trigger prophage induction, and the liberated prophages may become completely virulent [57].\n",
      "Overall, these studies suggest that prophage induction may responsible for triggering dysbiosis and changes in the microbial population by altering host phenotypes, thereby leading to a new environmental niche.\n",
      "Traditionally, host culture-dependent techniques, such as plaque assays, have been widely used for the identification of phage and host bacteria interactions.\n",
      "However, plaque assays require isolated host bacteria; so, they are low-throughput methods.\n",
      "This method is also difficult to apply to environmental samples where lysogenic infections are prevalent, because the method relies on observations of visible plaque formations, which are often absent from lysogenic infections [3, 58, 59].\n",
      "Recently, Deng et al.\n",
      "[52] demonstrated a new technique, known as \"viral tagging,\" for identifying the interactions between cultivated host bacteria and their phages, which used the nucleic acid stain SYBR Gold to generate fluorescently labeled phages, so that the host cells fluoresced with viral tagging, thereby allowing the sorting of virus-tagged cells by flow cytometry [52, 60].\n",
      "This emerging technique is undoubtedly helpful for not only exploring virus-host interactions in their natural habitats when the method is combined with other experimental tools, such as single viral genomics [61] and phageFISH [62], but also identifying viral receptors in macro-organisms (e.g., the mammalian gut) if the method is combined with a fluorescently labeled receptor protein during histological examinations.\n",
      "The emergence of viral metagenomics has facilitated advances in virology and allowed us to understand novel aspects of viral ecology.\n",
      "At present, viral metagenomics is a powerful and sensitive technique for detecting viruses that cannot be identified by traditional culture- and sequence-based approaches.\n",
      "Most importantly, viral metagenomics suggests that novel viruses interact constantly with the human population.\n",
      "Thus, viral metagenomics can facilitate the improved surveillance of viral pathogens in the fields of public health and food security.\n",
      "This technique can be used to understand viral ecology by exploring the environmental viromes that are generated by viral metagenomics.\n",
      "Overview of viral metagenomic studies conducted between 2002 and 2013.\n",

      "To understand the underlying genetic factors for OH traits (OH, dtSBP, and dtDBP), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using 333,651 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were conducted separately for two population-based cohorts, Ansung (n = 3,173) and Ansan (n = 3,255).\n",

      "This gene has also shown an association with insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function in the pancreas [25].\n",

      "The robustness of the backbone torsion angle method in structure alignment was partly validated before by the clustering analysis of 4 types of proteases [1].\n",
      "More distant groups of proteins were used for the assessment of the accuracy of the backbone torsion angle method here.\n",
      "A mixed set of 30 kinases and 30 proteases were clustered, and the accuracy of delineation was analyzed with the resulting 1,770 pairs (Fig.4).\n",
      "Trees of clustering from logPr (Fig.4A) and RamRMSD (Fig.4B) measurements showed an apparent delineation of kinases from proteases.\n",
      "The distances between these two groups were very long, so that one could easily recognize the perfect separation of each from the other.\n",
      "The distances among kinases and proteases each were rather comparable in the case of logPr measurements, while RamRMSD showed much shorter distances of proteases than those of the kinases.\n",
      "The difference between the distances of the two measurements might have originated from the weighting of the smaller distance in the case of logPr, which might have caused the distances among kinases to shrink.\n",
      "The logPr and RamRMSD tree showed a smaller distance between internodes than the distance between terminal leaves and the last internode, indicating that structural information is quite homogeneous within the group of identical functional homology.\n",
      "The clear discrimination of two homology group members indicates that the structural classification is strongly robust with the backbone torsion angle method, especially in the case of a lucid functional difference.\n",
      "The clustering tree from the TM-align RMSD measurement did not show clear delineations between kinases and proteases, while it showed some aggregations of each as subclusters (Fig.4C).\n",
      "Though 22 kinases were posed close to each other, members of this major cluster of kinases were in very close proximity to members of the protease group, making them hard to be clearly separated from proteases, referring the pair-wise distances.\n",
      "Furthermore, 8 kinases were posed within the cluster of proteases.\n",
      "The distribution of pair-wise distances among 60 proteins was also rather even.\n",
      "This incomplete separation markedly shows the better ability of our backbone torsion angle method than the conventional 3D alignment algorithm, like the TM-align method.\n",
      "The inferior performance of TM-align might be due to the inconsideration of connectional information among the matched Cα atoms.\n",
      "Neglect of this information might have made the algorithm crucially vulnerable to the similar ostensible shape, with different topology of the connecting backbones.\n",
      "According to our previous finding [2], the proteins generally adopt strong globular structures, and the most significant difference among proteins is the topology of the backbone structure.\n",
      "Thus, there is a possibility that TM-align might have been misled by the general globular positions of Cα atoms.\n",
      "This partly indicates the robustness of backbone torsion angle alignments and the possible problems of 3D methods that neglect the connectional information of matched reference points.\n",
      "The numerical measurement of accuracy of both of our new backbone torsion angle-based method and the typical 3D method of TM-align was performed with ROC curve analysis (Fig.4D).\n",
      "Fortunately, our new method, with both logPr and RamRMSD measurements, showed perfect accuracy, with an AUROC of 1.0, which means that every pair-wise distance might be correctly classified as true or false pairs.\n",
      "This clear discrimination reflects the long distance between the two groups in the trees of logPr and RamRMSD measurements (Fig.4A and 4B).\n",
      "The TM-align method with RMSD and TM-score measurements, however, showed no marked improvements in this more clearly distinctive set than the set of protease subtypes of a previous study [1], possibly indicating less robustness of 3D methods in more distinctive cases of functional differences.\n",
      "This is also shown by the similarity of the AUROCs of the RMSD (0.6846) and TM-score (0.6319) to the previous ones of 0.5965 and 0.5494 each.\n",
      "The TM-score result showed worse performance than that of the RMSD result in the TM-align method assessment.\n",

      "One of the primary goals of cancer genomics is to translate its discovery to clinical practice.\n",
      "Subsequent review articles provide perspectives on clinical informatics and methods on how to prioritize disease-related genes from next-generation sequencing data.\n",
      "Genome-wide data should be interpreted in the context of systems biology, and the following review articles offers comprehensive information on network biology and its applications.\n",
      "The next two review articles handle often overlooked but essential components of genomics, i.e., biobanks and ethical standards.\n",
      "We have two additional reviews, totaling 10.\n",
      "A couple of original research articles also address cancer genomics.\n",

      "Title: Interplay between Epigenetics and Genetics in Cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "Genomic instability, which occurs through both genetic mechanisms (underlying inheritable phenotypic variations caused by DNA sequence-dependent alterations, such as mutation, deletion, insertion, inversion, translocation, and chromosomal aneuploidy) and epigenomic aberrations (underlying inheritable phenotypic variations caused by DNA sequence-independent alterations caused by a change of chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications), is known to promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression.\n",
      "Mechanisms involve both genomic instability and epigenomic aberrations that lose or gain the function of genes that impinge on tumor suppression/prevention or oncogenesis.\n",
      "Growing evidence points to an epigenome-wide disruption that involves large-scale DNA hypomethylation but specific hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, large blocks of aberrant histone modifications, and abnormal miRNA expression profile.\n",
      "Emerging molecular details regarding the modulation of these epigenetic events in cancer are used to illustrate the alterations of epigenetic molecules, and their consequent malfunctions could contribute to cancer biology.\n",
      "More recently, intriguing evidence supporting that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are not separate events in cancer has been emerging; they intertwine and take advantage of each other during tumorigenesis.\n",
      "In addition, we discuss the collusion between epigenetics and genetics mediated by heterochromatin protein 1, a major component of heterochromatin, in order to maintain genome integrity.\n",
      "Cancers have traditionally been accepted as diseases that are induced by the accumulation of a set of genetic mutations that have been considered the major causes of neoplasia [1].\n",
      "But, is genomic instability a consequence of cancer progression or indeed a cause that drives cancer development?\n",
      "From about 1902 up until now, the involvement of genomic instability in tumorigenesis has long been the subjet of debate.\n",
      "In the beginning, Theodor Boveri's work with sea urchins showed that all chromosomes are required for normal development, known as the Boveri-Sutton chromosome theory.\n",
      "He had also suggested in 1902 that malignant tumors might be the result of a certain abnormal condition of the chromosomes, which may arise from multipolar mitosis.\n",
      "In the last century, remarkable findings and progresses in cancer research have added genomic instability to the hallmark list of cancer.\n",
      "Moreover, genomic instability generates the genetic and phenotypic heterogenicity and diversity that expedite tumorigenesis and the acquisition of cancer hallmarks.\n",
      "Our genomes are constantly threatened by a number of challenges that are originating from extracellular and intracellular stimuli.\n",
      "Effective cellular responses to these enormous genotoxic stresses are acutely required to maintain genomic integrity.\n",
      "These stresses can induce a variety of problems in the DNA, such as double-strand breaks, single-strand breaks, oxidative lesions, and pyrimidine dimers.\n",
      "Eukaryotes have evolved elaborate DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms to properly respond to the genotoxic stresses of these lesions.\n",
      "DNA damage induces several cellular responses, including checkpoint activation, DNA repair, and the triggering of apoptotic pathways for irreparable DNA damage (Fig.1).\n",
      "Underlying these DDRs are functions of many tumor suppressors, which are frequently lost in cancers.\n",
      "To keep the genome intact, DNA replication must be carried out without error, and if there is a mistake, it should be repaired correctly.\n",
      "Also, to give time for cells to repair any defect, cells must have intact checkpoint responses.\n",
      "Replicated genomes must be passed to daughter cells without error; therefore, either miscopying or missegregation of chromosomes should be avoided.\n",
      "If these self-guarding machineries are not effective, cells that have problems should die.\n",
      "So, DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription, cell cycle machinery, chromosome segregation, and apoptosis are six domains to keep genomic integrity.\n",
      "Also, these DDRs are coordinately regulated and work together, via a series of signaling pathways that eventually activate surveillance and checkpoints for genomic integrity.\n",
      "In other words, cancer cells have problems in these machineries, leading to genomic instability.\n",
      "The word \"epigenetics\" was termed in the early 1940s to describe the events that could not be wholly explained by traditional genetics [2].\n",
      "Conrad Waddington (1905-1975) defined epigenetics as \"the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products which bring the phenotype into being\" [3].\n",
      "The epigenetic field now actively uncovers the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena, and epigenetics has been defined today as \"the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence\" [4].\n",
      "In other words, epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression or phenotype, caused by mechanisms other than DNA sequences, and some of these epigenetic changes have even been shown to be heritable.\n",
      "Our genetic information is stored in the form of DNA as genetic code, but it has to be copied into RNA as an intermediate messenger or non-coding functional component.\n",
      "This copying process, transcription, is regulated at several steps, including initiation, elongation, and termination, by a variety of mechanisms.\n",
      "Moreover, eukaryotic transcription has to deal with chromatin templates, such that histone modifications and chromatin remodeling vastly affect gene expression.\n",
      "Several types of cancers and genetic disorders are often associated with abnormal transcription, highlighting the importance of regulated transcription in the pathology and prevention of cancers.\n",
      "Part of the genome has no transcribed information, which, however, has functional roles by various mechanisms.\n",
      "For example, cis elements (DNA sequences) can act as regulatory elements for transcription and replication.\n",
      "Also, centromeric DNA is required for mitotic and meiotic chromatin structure, and telomeric DNA plays a role in sheltering the ends of chromosomes and eventually guarding the genome.\n",
      "Indeed, centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin structures consist of specific repetitive sequences, which play a role in maintaining genomic integrity, such that heterochromatin structure is required for accurate chromosome segregation (centromere) and inhibiting DNA breakages and nonhomologous end-joining (telomere).\n",
      "Aneuploidy and chromosomal rearrangement, which are frequently observed in many cancers, are in part caused by aberrant chromatin structure.\n",
      "Generally, genomic instability is often associated with cancer and can be indicative of a poor prognosis for some types of cancer.\n",
      "Lately, this concept has now been expanded to the field of epigenetics, and disorganization of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms is prevalent in cancer [5, 6].\n",
      "Particular gene expression is determined not only by the genetic status of gene itself but also by epigenetic features, such as promoter regions, enhancers, and insulators, in chromatin and chromatin-modifying enzymes.\n",
      "Mutations in tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes induce a loss or gain of function, respectively, and abnormal expression of these genes are likely to be linked to cancer initiation.\n",
      "Feinberg proposed a hypothesis that epigenetic alterations can induce genetic changes and contribute to tumor progression and also initiation [7].\n",
      "Epigenetic changes occur without a change in the DNA sequence, and they can be induced by various factors, such as chromatin structure, including DNA methylation, histone variants, and modifications; nucleosome remodeling; and small non-coding regulatory RNAs (Fig.2) [8].\n",
      "In addition to histone proteins, DNA is associated with several nonhistone chromosomal proteins, including high-mobility group and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which can also play an important regulatory role in DNA-dependent processes, such as transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair, in a similar manner to histones.\n",
      "Title: Histone modifications and cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin that are composed of DNA wrapped around 8 histone core proteins [9].\n",
      "One of best understood epigenetic mechanisms is histone modification.\n",
      "The histone N-terminal tails protrude from nucleosome cores and thus are subject to numerous modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, and citrullination, creating a massively complex bar code.\n",
      "It is thought that activating or repressive complexes are recruited to DNA and reshape chromatin into relaxed or a tightly packed structure, based on the histone code-instructions through a combination of histone modifications [10].\n",
      "Like a writer, histone-modifying enzymes write the histone code via histone modifications and mark specific sites of the genome with histone modifications-for example, active promoter regions that are marked with augmented trimethylation in H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) inactive promoters that are marked with augmented trimethylated H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) or trimethylated H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), and enhancers that are marked with monomethylated H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and/or acetylated H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) [11-13].\n",
      "These histone modification patterns are regulated by a variety of enzymes, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases, which introduce and remove acetyl groups, respectively.\n",
      "Similarly, histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and demethylases introduce and remove methyl groups.\n",
      "The combination of histone modifications largely affects gene expression by the recruitment of transcriptional regulatory proteins, which bind to specific modified histone markings.\n",
      "Thus, a combination of histone modifications acts as a histone code-high-level information residing above the genetic code, which is genetic information stored in the form of DNA.\n",
      "Aberrant patterns of histone modification marks are often found in cancer.\n",
      "Advances in high-throughput sequencing have allowed for genome-wide mapping of chromatin changes that occur during tumor initiation and progression [8].\n",
      "A recent report suggested that cancer cells often experience losses of histone acetylation and methylation, occurring predominantly at the acetylated Lys16 and trimethylated Lys20 residues in histone H4.\n",
      "These losses are also associated with the hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences, which is a well-known characteristic of cancer cells [14].\n",
      "Title: DNA methylation and cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best studied epigenetic signals is DNA methylation.\n",
      "In contrast to a dazzling variety of histone modifications, DNA methylation is a simple covalent chemical modification, resulting in the attachment of a methyl (CH3) group at the 5' carbon position of the cytosine ring.\n",
      "When methyl groups are attached to the DNA in genes, transcription of these genes is usually turned off, and then these genes are silenced.\n",
      "When a cell divides, its DNA is copied via replication and divided equally into two daughter cells during mitosis.\n",
      "During this process, the pattern of DNA methylation can also be copied onto the new daughter DNA, allowing the information that determines whether a gene is \"on\" or \"off\" to be inherited to the two daughter cells [15].\n",
      "DNA methylation in mammals occurs mostly at CpG dinucleotides, and methylation of CpG islands explains a stable gene silencing mechanism [15].\n",
      "In normal somatic cells, most (over 50%) CpG islands are unmethylated.\n",
      "DNA methylation is important for the regulation of non-CpG islands, CpG island promoters, and repetitive sequences to maintain genome stability [15, 16].\n",
      "Furthermore, DNA methylation plays important roles in X chromosome inactivation, imprinting, embryonic development, silencing of repetitive elements and germ cell-specific genes, differentiation, and maintenance of pluripotency [16-18].\n",
      "DNA methylation is controlled by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the 5' position of cytosine bases in the CpG dinucleotide.\n",
      "Methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins, such as MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4, bind to methylated CpG sites and are involved in transcriptional repression [19].\n",
      "In cancer, hypomethylation usually occurs at repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation predominantly involves CpG islands [20].\n",
      "DNA hypermethylation has been shown to result in abnormal silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in most types of cancer [21].\n",
      "Thus, DNA methylation is grossly reduced, but DNA hypermethylation is specifically and locally augmented at CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes (Table 1); yet, its involvement and role in tumorigenesis remain controversial.\n",
      "Yet, experimental progress has added an emerging epigenetic aberration, \"aberrant DNA methylation,\" to an established cancer hallmark, \"genomic instability.\"\n",
      "DNA hypermethylation at tumor suppressors or genes having tumor suppressive functions is more frequent than their mutations in cancer cells.\n",
      "Hundreds to thousands of genes are hypermethylated in cancer cells, while only tens of genes are mutated.\n",
      "Epigenetic silencing via DNA methylation results in gene inactivation and promotes carcinogenesis, indicating that DNA methylation impinges on carcinogenesis.\n",
      "Title: MicroRNA and cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small noncoding RNAs that have epigenetic functions in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression via mRNA degradation or sequestering and translational repression and have physiologically essential roles in most cellular processes.\n",
      "Therefore, their dysfunction is implicated in human diseases, including cancer, as well as inherited diseases and developmental defects.\n",
      "The human genome may encode over 1,400 miRNAs, which frequently target many genes related to cancer development or prevention [22].\n",
      "In light of the linkage between miRNA and cancer, they have been categorized into three groups: oncogenic, tumor-suppressive, or context-dependent miRNAs [23].\n",
      "In tumorigenesis, the loss of tumor-suppressive miRNAs promotes the expression of target oncogenes, while increased expression of oncogenic miRNAs can repress target tumor suppressor genes [23].\n",
      "Mutations in a miRNA can disrupt its recognition of binding targets and further result in oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor repression.\n",
      "Indeed, oncogenic miRNAs, such as miR-155, miR-21, and miR-17 to -92, whose expression triggers cancer development, appear to be amplified, and tumor suppressive miRNAs, such as miR-146 and miR-15 to -16, whose loss triggers cancer development, appear to be downregulated in cancers [23].\n",
      "Moreover, mutations of miRNAs, including miR-101 and miR-29, targeting epigenetically modifying enzymes, such as EZH2 [24, 25] and DNMT3 [26], respectively, are often found in human cancers.\n",
      "Aberrant expression or mutation of such miRNAs is likely to further reinforce extensive and heavy epigenetic alterations [23, 27] and might have effects on histone or DNA methylation at promoters of other miRNAs that target oncogenes and tumor suppressors.\n",
      "Underexpression of miR-127, which targets BCL6, is correlated with abnormal methylation at its promoter in cancer [28].\n",
      "In the course of remarkable progress in the study of cancer epigenetics, new observations linking aberrant miRNA expression and tumorigenesis imply that miR-mimic molecules might serve as effective therapeutics by replacing tumor suppressor miRs or targeting oncogenic miRs.\n",
      "Many types of human cancers and disorders/diseases are often induced by misregulation of gene expression.\n",
      "Mechasnims for this misregulation involve both genetic mutations (genetic instability) and epigenetic modifications that disrupt the function of genes, including tumor suppressor and oncogenes, as well as other genes related to cancer, via altered activity or expression of the products of the genes.\n",
      "Given the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in tumor initiation and development, differentiating causative \"drivers\" (causes) and resulting \"passengers\" (outcomes) is becoming an important priority for cancer biology as well as epigenetics.\n",
      "Driver genes have to be essential for cancer causation, whereas passenger genes are not necessary [29].\n",
      "By the development and improvement of technology, it may eventually be possible to accurately and minutely distinguish epigenetic aberrations of driver genes [30, 31].\n",
      "Many current clinical investigations and trials of epigenetics-based cancer therapy, highlighting the reciprocal regulation of epigenetically modifying enzymes, miRNAs, and genetic defects in cancer, have come from scientific discoveries of how epigenetic aberrations in cancer manage to play a key role at every stage of tumorigenesis and have such a profound impact on the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Nevertheless, cooperation between epigenetics and genetics in tumorigenesis (Fig.3) is the subject of debate.\n",
      "The interconnection between these two processes becomes increasingly apparent, in large part because it is realized that mutations of various epigenetic modifier genes are associated with human cancers [32].\n",
      "The mutation of epigenetic modifiers presumably fosters profound epigenetic anomalies in terms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA, and nucleosome positioning and occupancy, which expedites global dysregulation of gene expression.\n",
      "Underlying this dysregulated epigenome is genomic instability, which generates mutations in epigenetic modifiers that induce abnormal gene expression, which may predispose one to cancer [32], although this remains to be demonstrated.\n",
      "Insight into its underlying mechanisms helps establish the epigenetic involvement in tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Because epigenetic processes involve a number of overlapping and interconnected mechanisms and pathways, it is difficult to definitely identify the cellular and molecular identities and the mechanism(s) underlying the epigenetic outcomes and phenotype.\n",
      "Based on studies of cell lines that have originated from tumor tissues and tissue samples collected from cancer patients, aberrant epigenetic marks can result in inappropriate expression of genes that are associated with cancer (tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes).\n",
      "It is now generally accepted that human cancer cells harbor global epigenetic abnormalities and that epigenetic alterations may be the key to tumor initiation and development [5, 6, 8].\n",
      "The cancer epigenome is characterized by substantial changes in various epigenetic regulatory layers; herein, we introduce some important examples of epigenetic disruptions that cause mutations of key genes and/or alterations of signaling pathways in cancer development.\n",
      "However, this idea has now been expanded to be a scientific norm by consolidating and incorporating the altered epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that are common and prevalent in cancer [5, 6].\n",
      "Both genetics and epigenetics ultimately involve abnormal gene expression-i.e., phenotype.\n",
      "The expression level of a particular gene is determined by its context at the genetic level, which consists of several cis elements, including promoters, regulatory regions, enhancers, and insulators, each of which recruits specific transcriptional proteins for activation, repression, and constitutive or facultative transcription by various mechanisms.\n",
      "In other words, cis elements can act as a primary platform for recruiting epigenome-modifying enzymes and/or chromatin remodeling factors.\n",
      "The modified epigenome follows immediately and acts as a secondary platform for transcriptional effector machinery.\n",
      "Finally, transcription is turned on or off, and its level is determined by the overall epigenomic context.\n",
      "The genetic road to cancer is relatively straightforward: mutation of tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes causes either a loss or gain of function and abnormal expression-namely the very relationship between altered genotypealtered phenotype.\n",
      "On the contrary, there are no genetic changes but a sick phenotype in the epigenetic road to cancer.\n",
      "The epigenetic pathway to cancer is much more complicated and roundabout and is determined by integrating numerous epigenetic variations, including DNA methylation, histone variants and modifications, and nucleosome remodeling, as well as small non-coding regulatory RNAs (Fig.2) [8].\n",
      "During tumor initiation and progression, the epigenome undergoes multiple alterations, including a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation (hypomethylation), frequent increases in promoter methylation of CpG islands, and aberrant changes in nucleosome occupancy and histone modification profile, and these epigenetic aberrations drive tumor cell heterogeneity, as well as tumorigenesis.\n",
      "Epigenetic aberration is a major feature of cancer, but its etiological role in tumor development remains controversial.\n",
      "This contrasts with genomic instability, which is known to produce cancer-causing mutations.\n",
      "Recent evidence demonstrates that a dysregulated epigenome can promote tumorigenesis via altered gene expression; however, the question of whether a dysregulated epigenome can predispose one to DNA damage and generate genomic instability remains clearly unaddressed.\n",
      "Only few possible mechanisms have been proposed; one possible mechanism by which chromosome segregation errors promote tumorigenesis is by inhibiting chromosome condensation for mitotic entry or destabilizing heterochromatin at centromeres, which facilitates chromosomal misalignment and accelerates the formation of unattached chromosomes or malfunctioning spindles.\n",
      "A second mechanism is chromosomal breakage and non-homologous end-joining, which result in chromosomal rearrangement and extensive structural alterations in chromosomes.\n",
      "Third, a dysregulated epigenome at telomeres promotes its elongation or chromosomal rearrangement.\n",
      "Intriguingly, histone deacetylase inhibitors or knockdown/knockout of epigenome modifiers can induce DNA damage, but whether this DNA damage can indeed predispose one to cancer remains unestablished.\n",

      "\n",
      "HP1 was originally identified in Drosophila, functioning in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing.\n",
      "Three different paralogs of HP1 are found in Drosophila melanogaster: HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c.\n",
      "Subsequently, orthologs of HP1 were also discovered in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Swi6), xenopus (Xhp1α and Xhp1γ), chicken (CHCB1, CHCB2, and CHCB3), and mammals (HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ) (Fig.4) [33, 34].\n",
      "HP1 binds directly to the methylated K9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9me), a surrogate marker for transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin, and is critical for its maintenance [35-37].\n",
      "Therefore, its canonical functions include maintaining heterochromatin integrity as a fundamental unit of heterochromatin, silencing by heterochromatin formation, and gene repression by heterochromatization of euchromatin.\n",
      "HP1 proteins are characterized by two conserved domains: the chromodomain (CD) in its N-terminus and the chromo shadow domain (CSD) in the C-terminus (Fig.4).\n",
      "The CD has been shown to directly bind H3K9me, while the CSD is implicated in interacting with a partner protein and its homo- and hetero-dimerization.\n",
      "Two CD and CSD domains are separated by a hinge domain that is involved in DNA and RNA binding (Figs.4 and 5) [38, 39].\n",
      "HP1 interacts with numerous epigenomic modifiers with different cellular functions in different organisms (Fig.5).\n",
      "Some of these HP1-interacting partners are histone methyltransferse, DNMT, and methyl CpG-binding protein MeCP2 (Fig.5), supporting its role in epigenomic modification.\n",
      "Title: HP1 and chromatin structure\n",
      "\n",
      "HP1 proteins are mostly enriched at heterochromatin centromeres and pericentromeric regions, telomeres and subtelomeric regions, and transcriptionally repressive genes.\n",
      "However, HP1 is also found at euchromatic sites [40, 41], though whether euchromatic HP1 has a disparate function and which HP1 paralog is located at euchromatin remain unclarified.\n",
      "A structure-based study revealed that a hydrophobic pocket of the HP1 CD interacts with histone H3K9me [42].\n",
      "This epigenetic mark is generated by a conserved family of HMTs, named after the Drosophila member SU (VAR)3-9, discovered as a suppressor factor involved in position-effect variegation [43, 44].\n",
      "Both HP1 and SU (VAR)3-9 function in heterochromatin structure formation.\n",
      "Loss of SU(VAR)3-9 results in displacement of HP1 from heterochromatic regions and alteration in gene repression [45].\n",
      "Mechanisms by which HP1 localizes to euchromatin sites appear to involve more than the recognition of H3K9me, which is poorly understood.\n",
      "An alternative mechanism of localization might be mediated via interactions between its CSD and other factors.\n",
      "HP1 CSD homodimerizes through an alpha-helical region and generates a platform that can interact with the PxVxL motif in its interacting partner proteins, such as DNMT1/3, SU(VAR) 3-9, and the p150 subunit of CAF-1 (Fig.5) [46].\n",
      "A second alternative mechanism of localization on chromatin involves interactions with RNA through a hinge domain, such that association of HP1 with specific loci in Drosophila and centric regions in mouse makes them susceptible to RNase treatment [39, 47].\n",
      "For example, it has been demonstrated that an HP1 subcode with sumoylation plays a role in heterochromatin architecture, via its association with microsatellite RNAs [48].\n",
      "A third mechanism for chromatin localization is found at the distal ends of Drosophila telomeres, where HP1 is thought to bind DNA directly [49].\n",
      "However, in mammals, localization of HP1 proteins to telomeric regions occurs via H3K9 association [50-53].\n",

      "The histone code hypothesis states that the type and combination of histone modifications are interpreted by the cell as instructions for organizing gene expression and constitutes the most advanced conceptual framework for deciphering the genetic information cascades that regulate gene expression.\n",

      "Clinicians are not confident in how much additional information might be given through genomics technology compared to conventional tools, and non-clinical scientists and bioinformaticians are not aware of what clinical problems should be solved with priority.\n",
      "Cancer clinicians expect novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic values of this new technology [1].\n",
      "Now, the clinical field is aware that multiple assays using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has some advantage over single genetic tests [1, 3].\n",
      "A recent cancer guideline from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) pointed out that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) testing should be conducted as part of multiplex/NGS in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [4].\n",
      "The feasibility of an NGS diagnostic platform at cancer clinics was validated by cancer centers in the United States [5] and Europe [6].\n",
      "One platform showed that potential hurdles, time, cost, purity, and ethical problems could be overcome in implementing NGS using low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and whole-transcriptome sequencing [5].\n",
      "Another platform sequenced clinical samples, including formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ones, and showed that this approach is practical and can give some benefits to the patients with lung cancer [6].\n",
      "The WES approach in Mendelian disorders showed that ~25% of sequencing can give a specific diagnosis based on the germline genetic make-up from the data of 250 probands, mostly consisting of neurological phenotypes in real practice [7].\n",
      "The clinical application of cancer genomics should be considered in the context of unmet clinical needs to maximize the value of this novel paradigm.\n",
      "Here, we dealt with the potential clinical application of cancer genomics in the aspect of practical management of cancer patients, along with a clinical scenario covering the whole course of cancer management.\n",
      "We overviewed the potential of cancer genomics in the context of real cancer practice through this approach.\n",
      "A 64-year-old male presented with a cough since 2 months ago.\n",
      "He quit smoking 10 years ago and had smoked an average of one pack per day for 30 years.\n",
      "He had regular check-ups every year and had the last check-up with no abnormality 6 months ago.\n",
      "His chest roentgenogram showed a mass shadow in the lung.\n",
      "He got a percutaneous needle aspiration (PCNA) and biopsy but did not have any tumor cells.\n",
      "He repeated the PCNA and biopsy but developed pneumothorax (air leakage from lung) related to the diagnostic procedure.\n",
      "His second biopsy showed some malignant cells, suggestive of adenocarcinoma.\n",
      "After a staging work-up with a computed tomography (CT) scan, positron-emission tomography (PET) scan, brain magnetic resonance imaging scan, and bronchoscopy, his tumor was revealed as T2N0 clinical stage.\n",
      "He got a surgery based on the result of the pathology and staging work-up.\n",
      "In this situation, we face unmet clinical needs of early cancer diagnosis.\n",
      "He was diagnosed with symptoms related to the cancer, despite his regular check-up.\n",
      "If we detect his malignancy before the symptoms, we can get a better result compared with the symptomatic case [8].\n",
      "This imaginary patient was diagnosed with operable cancer, but as many as 60% to 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with inoperable, advanced disease [9].\n",
      "To diagnose the cancer sooner, screening procedures have been studied extensively in the clinical field.\n",
      "Lots of trials failed to show an actual benefit of screening strategy in lung cancer [10, 11], but recently, a screening trial using low-dose chest CT of lung cancer was proven to be successful [8].\n",
      "Low-dose chest CT reduced the mortality from lung cancer through early detection in people with a history of at least 30 pack-years of smoking.\n",
      "Despite this good approach to detect early lung cancer, the reduction of mortality is 20% [8].\n",
      "This advantage should be counterbalanced with the potential harmful effects of radiation exposure or false positivity [12].\n",
      "One important usage of genomics should be early detection.\n",
      "Many biomarkers were investigated for the early detection of lung cancer-for example, circulating tumor DNA and RNA [13].\n",
      "But, false positivity and false negativity of single tests prevent these tests from clinical usage.\n",
      "If we use multiple biomarkers using cancer genomics for the detection of early cancer, the false positives and negatives could be reduced to the level of clinical usage.\n",
      "Another effective approach of early diagnosis of cancer is to select a high-risk population for screening tests.\n",
      "Many genome-wide association studies identified some germline single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that are associated with the risk of cancers [14-16], and these findings suggested important potential germline markers for the definition of high-risk populations.\n",
      "Dr. Mardis told the case of Mike Snyder as an example of an actual application of a germline genome test [17].\n",
      "He sequenced his own genome and found a higher risk of type 2 diabetes; since that time, he checked his glucose level regularly, and he detected high glucose levels at the very beginning.\n",
      "After that, he exercised regularly and returned to normal glucose levels.\n",
      "The concept of early diagnosis, like the story of Mike Snyder, can be applied to the early detection of cancer, too.\n",
      "If we define a high-risk population with germline genetic tests, we could focus on the use of screening tests in this population.\n",
      "This approach will also save money on screening tests for the whole population.\n",
      "This patient had a bad experience of pneumothorax.\n",
      "This complication gives pain and discomfort of the sensation of dyspnea, prolongs the period of admission, and increases the cost of cancer management.\n",
      "This problem originated from the invasive nature of the diagnostic procedure-PCNA and biopsy using a needle, moving back and forth through the patient's fragile lung tissue.\n",
      "New diagnostic tools using cancer genomics-for example, identification of cancer-specific genetic alterations from circulating tumor DNA-can avoid this type of complication from invasive procedures.\n",
      "One pioneering study showed that circulating tumor DNA could be combined with genomic technology to diagnose and monitor the status of cancer very safely [18].\n",
      "He underwent surgery performed by thoracic surgeons.\n",
      "His final pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma and revealed the involvement of some mediastinal lymph nodes; therefore, the final pathological stage was T2N2, IIIA.\n",
      "This stage required adjuvant chemotherapy, and he was referred to the department of medical oncology.\n",
      "A medical oncologist prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy-a navelbine and cisplatin regimen (NP) for 4 cycles.\n",
      "NP 4 cycles has been prescribed to patients with high-risk clinical stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB, regardless of other clinicopathological factors.\n",
      "The actual benefit from this treatment is only a 4% long-term survival advantage, with some hematological and non-hematological toxicities [19, 20].\n",
      "The way to improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of adjuvant treatment is further selection of a patient population that could benefit from this treatment.\n",
      "Stage-based risk calculation-the current practice-cannot predict an accurate risk of relapse and attenuates the value of adjuvant treatment.\n",
      "Single patient-based risk calculation should be done to identify the adequate patients for adjuvant treatment.\n",
      "Cancer genomics will provide useful tools for a single patient-based risk calculation model.\n",
      "This personalized adjuvant model will definitely increase the proportion of patients who benefit from it.\n",
      "There are also clinical needs of prognosis prediction even before surgery.\n",
      "Surgical management of stage IIIA is controversial.\n",
      "If he had been diagnosed as stage IIIA preoperatively, he might have chosen a no-surgery option, such as concurrent chemoradiation, because no definite benefit of surgery was demonstrated until now, although this is controversial [21, 22].\n",
      "We have relatively sensitive diagnostic methods, such as CT, PET, and endobronchial ultrasonography, but the sensitivity and specificity are still not perfect.\n",
      "One focus of genomics technology should be a more accurate prognosis preoperatively, in addition to postoperatively.\n",
      "Prediction issues in cancer patients are not limited to survival, recurrence, and response to specific treatment.\n",
      "The goal of cancer care is improvement of survival and, more importantly, quality of life.\n",
      "Predictive markers of bone metastasis or bone-related events, such as fracture or paralysis, are very important to improve the quality of life in cancer patients.\n",
      "We have no clinically validated markers to predict these events [23].\n",
      "An unbiased approach is needed to discover good biomarker for these events, because we have very limited clues to dig into these problems.\n",
      "The most important advantage of genomics approach is that is \"unbiased\" with regard to any hypotheses or theories.\n",
      "That is why clinical problems with low-depth knowledge are a good candidate for the application of cancer genomics.\n",
      "The connection between clinicians and genomic scientists can facilitate the development of clinical problems that are solved with a genomic approach.\n",
      "He got 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and then followed up regularly with a physical examination, blood test, CT scan, and/or PET scan.\n",
      "At 6 months since the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, he presented with right-side chest pain, and his CT scan showed tumor relapse in the right lung and pleura.\n",
      "He planned systemic anticancer treatment for life prolongation and palliation of symptom, not curative.\n",
      "The role of CT scan and/or PET scan is not defined [24], but many clinicians use this high-cost image for monitoring relapse.\n",
      "The reason for the popular use of this high-cost image is that there is no other alternative of monitoring cancer status.\n",
      "Recent studies showed the possibility of circulating tumor cell and cell-free DNA as a tool for monitoring tumor status [18, 25].\n",
      "Cancer genomics enables circulating tumor cell or cell-free DNA to detect relapse earlier than image findings or tumor markers.\n",
      "The delicate delineation of circulating DNA with NGS technologies is an essential part of this success story.\n",
      "No tool is available with a definite clinical benefit for the monitoring of cancer; therefore, we absolutely need new, non-invasive tools for it.\n",
      "Because it takes at least several years to prove the benefit of monitoring, we should start a well-designed prospective study using cancer genomics to prove it as soon as possible.\n",
      "The medical oncologist who was in charge of him tested for EGFR mutation and ALK by fluorescence in situ hybridization to see rearrangements of ALK.\n",
      "Tests showed no EGFR mutation and no ALK translocation.\n",
      "He chose cytotoxic chemotherapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin according to the double-negative results of the EGFR and ALK tests.\n",
      "The ultimate goal of the clinical application of cancer genomics should be therapeutics.\n",
      "There are increasing gene lists for NSCLC that have matching targeted agents [26, 27], but many patients do not have genetic alterations that can be a target.\n",
      "Even for the same type of cancer-for example, lung adenocarcinoma-the genetic make-up is very heterogeneous.\n",
      "The accurate definition of the genetic make-up of each patient will be the first step for personalized medicine.\n",
      "Many target panels have been developed by many vendors and hospitals for commercial or non-commercial use [3], but the usage is still very limited.\n",
      "As more cancer genome data are available [28, 29], the list of target panels will increase and be specified to tumor types.\n",
      "Now, we have two targeted agents to prolong the survival of lung cancer patients: the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib or gefitinib for EGFR mutations and the ALK TKI crizotinib for ALK translocations.\n",
      "For this case, there was no targeted agent, because he did not have EGFR or ALK alterations.\n",
      "Based on the histology of his tumor, he was treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin [30].\n",
      "Despite the substantial toxicity of cytotoxic chemotherapy, many patients are prescribed these drugs with the individualized possibility of this agent not known.\n",
      "This decision relies on population data from large-scale prospective trials.\n",
      "Because clinical trials targeting specific genetic alterations are increasing, the clinical need for more genetic information is also increasing [31].\n",
      "If the patient was diagnosed as stage IV initially, the amount of tissue for genetic testing is very limited.\n",
      "The amount of tissue is enough for 2 or 3 genetic tests.\n",
      "For these patients, multiplexing or NGS technologies have important advantages to overcome the limitation of tissue amounts in the clinic.\n",
      "This patient got adjuvant chemotherapy with NP for 4 cycles but progressed 6 months after the completion.\n",
      "We guess that the patient did not benefit from NP for 4 cycles.\n",
      "The usual speculation is whether there is a better way to choose adjuvant treatment.\n",
      "The way to increase the benefit of adjuvant treatment could be the application of variable adjuvant treatment that is selected from individualized factors.\n",
      "Personalized cancer genomic analysis can show different and private profiles of individual cancers, and accumulation of these genomic data enables different adjuvant treatment strategies for each patient.\n",
      "Despite the theoretical promise of personalized cancer genomic analysis for the selection of the right drug, there are few examples of this direct application of cancer genomics.\n",
      "One of important example is the story of Lukas Wartman, a doctor at Washington University in St. Louis [32].\n",
      "He suffered from a second relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and sequenced the tumor DNA and RNA.\n",
      "He found very high expression of FLT3 and then figured out that sunitinib, a kidney cancer drug, could block tumor survival signals.\n",
      "Sunitinib induced complete remission in him, and thereafter, he received allogeneic stem cell transplantation and is now in remission.\n",
      "Another story from the Fox Chase Cancer Center was reported on KIT mutations from a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [33].\n",
      "The patient had an advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and sequenced his tumor using a cancer panel.\n",
      "He had a KIT mutation and was treated with imatinib, a well-known KIT inhibitor that is not approved for his tumor, for more than 2 years.\n",
      "If he had been in in routine practice without cancer panel sequencing, he would have died without imatinib treatment.\n",
      "A pharmacogenomic approach could be used to minimize toxicity to cancer treatment, too.\n",
      "In this case, we usually see germline SNP data.\n",
      "Some germline SNPs are already known to predict erratic side effects to specific drugs.\n",
      "One example is the UGT1A1 germline polymorphism for the metabolism and toxicity of irinotecan.\n",
      "If the patient has a homozygous polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene-the *28 variant-he should be prescribed with a dose reduction to avoid severe, sometimes fatal, toxicity from irinotecan.\n",
      "A genomic approach is required to properly assess pharmacogenomics in association with drug toxicity.\n",
      "A commercial chip, the Affymetric DMET chip, covers 25-32% of genes of pharmacogenomics, and it is an important question whether more coverage with WES will be more beneficial.\n",
      "He was treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin for 4 cycles, and his tumor shrank with the treatment.\n",
      "But, his tumor rebounded, with a complaint of dyspnea and cough, 4 months after the completion of treatment.\n",
      "After 4 cycles of second-line chemotherapy with docetaxel, he had stable disease.\n",
      "Even in the case of a dramatic response to the first-line treatment, nearly all cancers rebound with various relapse-free durations [30, 34].\n",
      "The choice of second-line treatment depends on clinical guidelines, clinical parameters, and clinicians' experiences.\n",
      "Any of the parameters may not be best if a specific patient's situation is not considered.\n",
      "We do not know the exact mechanism of resistance to the previous treatment and do not have any good way to assess the mechanism of resistance.\n",
      "If cancer genomics is adopted in this situation, we can profile the tumor tissue that was resistant to the previous treatment.\n",
      "The profile can help clinicians decide on a second-line treatment option and improve the individual's outcome.\n",
      "The resistance mechanism could vary, depending on multidimensional factors, such as the patient, tumor biology, and previous treatment.\n",
      "Especially, this situation should be approached individually with the concept of true personalized medicine.\n",
      "His disease began to grow again and he refused further cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n",
      "He was in hospice care and died 1 year after the initial diagnosis of relapse.\n",
      "After his death, his tumor was sequenced by whole-transcriptome analysis, and his tumor showed a ROS1 translocation.\n",
      "Now, a ROS1 inhibitor is available for this type of cancer.\n",
      "The median overall survival of metastatic lung cancer patients is 1 year if there is no genetic alteration for which targeted agents are available [30, 34], as in this case.\n",
      "If the patient has an EGFR-sensitive mutation or ALK translocation, the median overall survival time reaches 2 years [35, 36].\n",
      "A ROS1 targeting agent, another example of successful targeting of oncogene addiction, is now available after his death [27].\n",
      "If the ROS1 translocation was known for his tumor and he was treated with a ROS1 inhibitor, he could have a chance to live an additional one year or more.\n",
      "Tumors have very heterogeneous profiles [37, 38], and resistant tumors have even more heterogeneous ones [39].\n",
      "This is why tumors should ultimately be approached on an individual basis, rather than a population basis.\n",
      "Now is the right time to think about how we can use cancer genomics for individual patients.\n",
      "There are still lots of technological hurdles-e.g., functional annotation of sequencing results, the way to integrate multi-dimensional data, and the exploration of the clinical meaning of sequencing variants for the routine clinical usage of cancer genomics.\n",
      "Defining unmet clinical needs is as important as overcoming technological hurdles to maximize the benefit from cancer genomics.\n",
      "Early detection, non-invasive molecular diagnosis, risk prediction of relapse and tumor-related events, monitoring of disease status, matching good drugs, and finding out personal grade resistance mechanisms are good examples of unmet clinical needs that should be solved with cancer genomics.\n",
      "It would speed up and optimize the application of genomics to cancer clinics if cancer biologists, bioinformaticians, and cancer clinicians cooperate towards one goal of achieving it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Development of liver cancers is driven largely by genomic alterations that deregulate signaling pathways, influencing growth and survival of cancer cells.\n",
      "Because of the hundreds or thousands of genomic/epigenomic alterations that have accumulated in the cancer genome, it is very challenging to find and test candidate genes driving tumor development and progression.\n",
      "Systematic studies of the liver cancer genome have become available in recent years.\n",
      "These studies have uncovered new potential driver genes, including those not previously known to be involved in the development of liver cancer.\n",
      "Novel approaches combining multiple datasets from patient tissues have created an unparalleled opportunity to uncover potential new therapeutic targets and prognostic/predictive biomarkers for personalized therapy that can improve clinical outcomes of the patients with liver cancer.\n",
      "Primary liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, accounting for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually [1].\n",
      "In Korea, liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths (10,946 death in 2010) [2].\n",
      "In the United States, primary liver cancer has gained major interest, because the incidence of liver cancer has increased over the past 25 years, and the incidence and mortality rate of liver cancer are expected to double over the next 10 to 20 years [3-5].\n",
      "Therefore, prevention and treatment of liver cancer are of great concern.\n",
      "While primary liver cancer is one of the few cancers with well-defined major risk factors, such as hepatitis virus infection, alcohol consumption, and obesity, the molecular pathogenesis of liver cancer is not well understood [6-8].\n",
      "Patients with liver cancer have a highly variable clinical course [7, 9], indicating that liver cancer comprises several biologically distinct subgroups.\n",
      "Therefore, it will be necessary to understand liver cancer at a genomic and molecular level for improved stratification of patients, identification of novel druggable targets, and development of personalized treatment, based on the biological characteristics of tumors in each patient.\n",
      "Due to the complex nature of cancers that are initiated by activation of many different oncogenes or inactivation of different tumor suppressor genes and progress by additional genetic or epigenetic alterations, conventional gene-by-gene approaches are likely to deliver only a limited understanding of the biological and pathological characteristics of cancer cells.\n",
      "However, the recent development of technologies for gene expression profiling, genome-wide copy number analysis, and whole-genome sequencing has enabled the comprehensive characterization of entire cancer genomes.\n",
      "This information promises to improve our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic alterations driving the development of liver cancer, as well as ultimately provide guidance on personalized treatment of patients.\n",
      "Although these large-scale genomic data promise improvement in the treatment of liver cancer, challenges remain for the management and integration of these data for a better understanding of how these alterations give rise to the development of liver cancer and, most importantly, the translation of these findings into personalized patient treatment.\n",

      "Since the discovery of frequent genetic rearrangements and copy number aberrations in the cancer genome [10], cytogenetic methods have been used widely to find the genetic changes in cancer genomes.\n",
      "The CGH method was the first tool to provide a genome-wide investigation of copy-number alterations in cancer [11].\n",
      "Increased or decreased regions of copy number are believed to have either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.\n",
      "Although the resolution of early CGH mapping technology is limited by 2 Mbp (high-copy-number amplifications) to 10 Mbp (low-copy-number amplification or deletion), this method has identified many loci for oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in liver cancer.\n",
      "Multiple studies have reported amplification of the 8q24 loci, in which MYC is located [12-15].\n",

      "This technology was first used to make a quantitative assessment of mRNAs or non-coding RNAs.\n",
      "Gene expression profiling studies based on microarray technologies have identified conserved gene expression signatures that are significantly related with clinical outcomes or pathological phenotypes and have uncovered many subgroups of cancer that were not recognized with conventional approaches in a variety of cancers [16-18].\n",
      "These approaches have been used successfully to identify therapeutic targets for various cancers and to predict overall survival or recurrence-free survival rates of cancer patients [19-21].\n",
      "Use of microarray technology is not restricted to genome-wide gene expression profiling of cells or tissues but expands to uncovering single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cancer risk, methylation status of gene promoters, DNA copy number alterations, protein expression profiling, and re-sequencing of cancer genomes.\n",
      "Because microarray-based CGH can provide copy-number analyses with much higher resolution than conventional CGH, it has quickly replaced conventional CGH [22, 23].\n",
      "Microarray technologies were also adopted by the proteomics community.\n",
      "Protein microarray was quickly established by rapid improvements to miniaturizing western blotting and tissue lysate dotting technologies onto solid surfaces.\n",
      "There are two different experimental approaches for protein arrays: forward-phase protein array (FPPA) and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA).\n",
      "In FPPA, antibodies or polypeptides are printed on the slide surface, and each slide?is incubated with labeled tissue or cell lysate.\n",
      "This approach allows one to simultaneously measure multiple protein features, such as expression, interaction with peptide ligands, and protein phosphorylation, from the samples.\n",
      "In RPPA, an individual tissue lysate in printed on the slide surface, and each RPPA slide consists of hundreds or thousands of tissue samples.\n",
      "Each slide is then probed with one peptide ligand or antibody at a time, and a protein feature of interest is assessed and compared across many tissues or cell lines.\n",
      "Because RPPA needs only several thousands of cells to collect high-quality data, it is better suited for cancer research.\n",
      "In contrast, FPPA is not suitable for tissue-based studies, because it needs a large quantity of tissue or cell lysate for detection [24-27].\n",

      "Due to the emergence of second-generation sequencing technologies that allow massive parallel collection of sequence information, the cost per base for sequencing the entire genome has reduced dramatically [28].\n",
      "These new technologies provided unique opportunities to investigate all sequences of entire cancer genomes to uncover the genetic changes that arise during cancer development.\n",
      "Many different technologies have been developed by different companies: Roche Applied Science (454 Genome Sequencer FLX System; Indianapolis, IN, USA), Life Technologies (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection or SOLiD; Carlsbad, CA, USA), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II; San Diego, CA, USA), Helicos BioSciences (HeliScope Single Molecule Sequencer; Cambridge, MA, USA), and Ion Torrent Systems (now owned by Life Technologies, Ion Proton System).\n",
      "These new technologies have been used to identify potential driver mutations in the development of liver cancer through whole-genome and -exome sequencing.\n",
      "The first sequencing of the primary liver cancer genome revealed a total of 11,731 somatic mutations [29].\n",
      "Following studies showed that the CTNNB1, TP53, and EGFR genes were frequently mutated in liver cancer [30-33].\n",
      "Additionally, the ARID family, including ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2, was mutated in about half of all tumors, suggesting a potential role of them in the development of liver cancer.\n",
      "In previous studies [18, 34-37], gene expression data from human liver cancer have identified several subgroups that are significantly associated with clinical outcomes, such as overall survival and recurrence-free survival.\n",
      "These findings strongly indicated that gene expression patterns faithfully reflect biological and pathological heterogeneity among patients with liver cancer and would be highly valuable in predicting the clinical outcome of patients.\n",
      "The current challenge for clinical use is to identify those who will not benefit from conventional treatments and to offer alternative therapies.\n",
      "If master drivers, such as genes or pathways determining the biological characteristics of the tumors, can be identified, we can explore their therapeutic potentials.\n",
      "However, gene expression profiling approaches are also limited, because they only provide information related to transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "Title: Integromics: Integration of multiple-omics data\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous studies undoubtedly showed that gene expression patterns (or signatures) are useful markers that can stratify patients and offer useful prognostic information [18, 37-42].\n",
      "The current research focus has moved to uncovering genetic/epigenetic factors that are key regulators of specific signaling pathways altered in malignant cancer cells, potentially guiding the discovery of new therapeutic (and druggable) targets [8, 43-45].\n",
      "But, the selection of such candidates for future validations from long gene lists produced by genome-wide screening is a significant challenge because of potential confounding factors embedded in many genome-wide data from human cancers.\n",
      "Furthermore, because the gene expression data from tumor tissues only provide \"snapshot\" information of genetic/epigenetic alterations and lack in-depth information on interactive and time-dependent alterations during tumor progression, it is not easy to distinguish the driver genes from passenger genes whose alterations simply echo changes in cell proliferation or organ physiology.\n",
      "As discussed earlier, CGH analyses have identified many recurrent candidate loci of DNA copy number changes in liver cancer.\n",
      "Some of these genomic regions have well-recognized tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes.\n",
      "However, because of the large number of candidate genes in the identified genomic loci, functional validation of all candidates would be impractical.\n",
      "Thus, there is an urgent demand for development of a new approach that would quickly prioritize candidates according to the likelihood of their direct involvement in tumor development.\n",
      "In a previous study, systematic integration of gene copy number data and gene expression from the same patients has been proposed to identify potential driver genes [46].\n",
      "This study demonstrated that DNA copy number alteration data provide additional prognostic significance.\n",
      "Integrative analysis of copy number alteration data and gene expression further identified 50 driver candidates whose activation was triggered by copy number amplifications of genes and also significantly associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes in liver cancer.\n",
      "Alterations in DNA copy number and expression patterns of thousands of genes are important characteristics of many cancer cells.\n",
      "Because the use of high-throughput microarray-based technologies, mass spectrometry, and second-generation sequencers for the analysis of cancer genomes inevitably produces many false-positive results, it is not easy to select practical numbers of candidate genes for future evaluation of them as therapeutic targets and/or prognostic/predictive biomarkers.\n",
      "Therefore, it is important to combine two or more genomic scale datasets (e.g., array-based CGH data, promoter methylation, and expression of coding or non-coding genes), collected independently from the same tissues (Fig.1).\n",
      "RPPA is a newly established proteomic technology [24-27] that provides quantitative assessment of the expression and modification of many proteins.\n",
      "For example, the phosphorylation level of particular proteins can be estimated easily by using antibodies specific to certain phosphorylation sites of proteins.\n",
      "Use of the phosphorylation antibodies allows us to assess the signaling pathways by looking at many kinase substrates simultaneously through multiplexed phosphorylation-specific antibody analysis.\n",
      "However, assessment of signaling pathways by RPPA is restricted by the availability of antibodies with very high specificity.\n",
      "This limitation can be overcome by integration of multiple datasets for systematic analysis.\n",
      "Integration of proteomic data with genomic data would significantly help us have better insights into tumor development and progression.\n",

      "The goal of TCGA is to collect comprehensive genomic and proteomic information on all major human cancers, including liver cancer.\n",
      "Initial efforts focused on glioblastoma, lung squamous cell cancer, and ovarian cancer as pilot projects [47-50].\n",
      "By using various different platforms, TCGA currently gathers many different genome-wide data, including mRNA expression, microRNA expression, somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and promoter methylation.\n",
      "In addition, it also generates proteomic data by using RPPA technology.\n",
      "The project plans to collect genomic and proteomic data from more than 500 tissues per cancer type and release the data to the public without any restriction in use of the data (Table 1).\n",
      "This ambitious project has identified novel driver genes and biomarkers on the basis of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic alterations.\n",
      "Some findings are clinically relevant and unexpected.\n",
      "For example, we have now learned that non-hypermutated adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum are not distinguishable at the genomic level [51].\n",
      "In lung squamous cell cancer, while KRAS and EGFR mutations, the most commonly activated oncogenes in lung adenocarcinoma, are extremely rare, alterations in the FGFR kinase family are common [49].\n",
      "Thus, massive data from a large number of tissues have created an unprecedented opportunity for taking an integrated approach toward a systems-level understanding of disruptions in cellular and molecular pathways in cancer.\n",
      "Genomics has become a dominant tool for understanding cancer biology, revealing unexpected surprises and providing cancer classification according to biological differences.\n",
      "The amount of liver cancer-related genomic data that have generated during the past few years is really incredible.\n",
      "Analysis approaches of these data have been advanced to efficiently process this information and allow us to perform integrated genome-wide analysis on a scale previously unthinkable.\n",
      "These approaches are also beginning to investigate the dense network of molecular pathways driving the development of liver cancer.\n",
      "The anticipated benefits of these data will be more a faithful assessment of prognosis than the current stage system, improved prediction of treatment response, and discovery of new therapeutic targets.\n",
      "Future challenges lie in translating this discovery into personalized treatment for the patient with liver cancer.\n",
      "Integromics approaches.\n",

      "The extraction, transformation, and load is essential for converting and integrating distributed healthcare data.\n",
      "Ad hoc reporting tools using online analytical processing technology are used to gain intuitive and simple analysis results in clinical informatics.\n",

      "In less than a decade, the Human Genome Project has been established to generate a large amount of biological data to practice diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics [19].\n",
      "The central products using standardized data model are GenBank [20], SWISS-PROT [21], Exon-Intron [22], and IMGT [23].\n",
      "However, standardized data models for integrated bioclinical data warehouses have not been developed yet.\n",
      "This area will be important to allow researchers to rapidly spread information throughout the world and inspire thousands of research projects.\n",
      "The experience in designing storages for digital radiological imaging, also known as picture archiving and communication system (PACS), may provide some guidance in bioinformatics data warehouses.\n",
      "In PACS, one has multiple image storages that are not necessarily part of EMR; however, the diagnostic reports are part of the EMR.\n",
      "The PACS images are then made available to physicians as needed.\n",
      "Title: Analytics\n",

      "The analytics technology that is commonly used for these systems is mainly traditional data mining techniques developed in the 1980s.\n",
      "The popular term of analysis technology in the business and computer science communities in the 1990s was business intelligence.\n",
      "Recently, technologies that require advanced and unique data storage, management, analysis, and visualization became important in applications that are very large and complex databases.\n",
      "Title: Standardization\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of standardized vocabularies for clinical informatics has hampered the development of automated clinical decision support systems.\n",
      "Finding the laboratory term representing the same meaning of serum sodium for different database systems is troublesome in multi-center data integration.\n",
      "The National Library of Medicine has developed the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to enable these different vocabularies to be interoperable by developing a vocabulary at least at a basic level [24].\n",
      "The same problems are known in bioinformatics.\n",
      "DNA sequences have different names and are joined in some databases only with varying levels of confidence.\n",
      "Codification of molecular diagnostic or cytogenetic results using existing medical vocabularies will have difficulties due to a lack of sufficient terms for molecular findings.\n",
      "For example, the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) has minimal codes related to the description of molecular diagnostic findings.\n",
      "The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) vocabulary has recently added a significant number of molecular pathology terms; however, it lacks the rich context-defining relationships provided by ontology [24].\n",
      "The Clinical Bioinformatics Ontology (CBO) addresses this gap by providing uniquely identified concepts related to clinically significant molecular findings.\n",
      "The CBO consists of nearly 7,000 concepts, each of which is associated with a global unique identifier, and is associated with more than 15,500 relationships [25-27].\n",
      "As the efforts to integrate two different domains are increased, vocabulary issues will be essential.\n",
      "Title: Privacy\n",
      "\n",
      "Individual genomic data are easily identifiable and can be used to predict current and future health status.\n",
      "Thus, extracting knowledge from large health data employs a significant risk of privacy information breach; thus, researchers need to consider Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements for building a privacy-preserving and trustworthy database infrastructure and conducting research [28].\n",
      "When personal genetics data can be incorporated into EMR systems, different safeguards to ensure confidentiality will be required.\n",
      "A de-identified bio-data warehouse combining traditional clinical and genomic information will be essential to conduct translational research.\n",
      "One major difference between the EMR community and BI community is the degree of multidisciplinary open collaboration.\n",
      "In EMRs, multidisciplinary collaborative efforts have been limited.\n",
      "Most of the EMR systems in use today are based on proprietary software that hampers data exchange with other systems.\n",
      "In the BI community, global collaboration, aided by wide use of open source software and development methodologies, has been a key success factor.\n",
      "The BI community has been global in scope from the beginning, and information sharing and free exchange of software tools have ushered in the era of open source software in health informatics.\n",
      "There is a great need for the EMR community to adopt more open source software methodologies that would allow rapid global collaboration (http://www.osehra.org).\n",
      "Genomic technologies hold the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of inherited and complex diseases-including cancer- and facilitate the move towards personalized predictive medicine.\n",
      "The higher throughput and rapidly falling costs of next-generation sequencing have resulted in voluminous genomic data and downstream computational challenges.\n",
      "Thus, the shift from this powerful discovery research to clinical implementation can only be accomplished with careful integration with EMRs, a frontline patient care tool.\n",
      "The most prominent reason to integrate clinical information and biology information under the same system is to provide opportunities for bi-directional exchange of data, technology, and knowledge between two disciplines with different histories and cultures.\n",

      "\n",
      "High-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology produces a tremendous amount of raw sequence data.\n",
      "The challenges for researchers are to process the raw data, to map the sequences to genome, to discover variants that are different from the reference genome, and to prioritize/rank the variants for the question of interest.\n",
      "The recent development of many computational algorithms and programs has vastly improved the ability to translate sequence data into valuable information for disease gene identification.\n",
      "However, the NGS data analysis is complex and could be overwhelming for researchers who are not familiar with the process.\n",
      "Here, we outline the analysis pipeline and describe some of the most commonly used principles and tools for analyzing NGS data for disease gene identification.\n",
      "The breakthrough in next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has enabled rapid sequencing of whole genomes at low cost and has brought tremendous opportunities as well as challenges to biomedical research [1-5].\n",
      "The cost of sequencing is projected to continue to drop, with whole-genome sequencing expected to be as low as $1000 [4] and whole-exome sequencing (i.e., sequencing approximately 1% of the coding regions of the genome [6]) to be $500 [1].\n",
      "Such low costs enable a small research lab to generate large amounts of sequence data in a short period of time on a relatively small budget.\n",
      "The low cost also allows sequencing-based clinical genetic tests to be routinely performed to provide guidance for health professionals for disease etiology and management.\n",
      "The challenge now is how to reliably synthesize and interpret this large amount of raw data from sequencing platforms.\n",
      "One goal of genomic research is to determine which genes are causal for the disease of interest.\n",
      "With the NGS data, this is not a trivial task.\n",
      "Large-scale whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing analyses identify large amounts of genomic variants, most of which are not related to disease risk.\n",
      "Thus, disease gene prioritization principles and tools are needed [2] to identify and prioritize variants of interest from the large pool of candidates.\n",
      "Currently, identifying candidate causal mutations/genes is often a complex practice that involves several dozens of steps and/or tools to accomplish.\n",
      "These tools work jointly in a series of steps and thus functionally form a \"workflow\" or a \"pipeline.\"\n",
      "Ideally, the process of disease gene prioritization generates an ordered list of genes that puts high-risk candidates on the top of the stack and filters out \"benign\" or neutral variants.\n",
      "In reality, this process usually involves multiple filtering steps, some of which have underlying assumptions that can affect how variants are filtered.\n",
      "The focus of this review is to provide a broad overview of the workflow and present some of the bioinformatics software tools that are currently available.\n",
      "More in-depth comparisons of the bioinformatics algorithms and tools are described elsewhere [3, 5].\n",
      "Typically, the output from NGS platforms is in the standard FASTQ format.\n",
      "The FASTQ file is a text file containing a list of short DNA fragments, generally less than 150 base pairs (bp) long, and a list of quality scores associated with the DNA fragments.\n",
      "For whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing, a FASTQ file contains millions of records.\n",
      "For example, the human exome is ~50 million base pairs (Mbp), and a typical whole-exome sequencing dataset has at least 30X depth of coverage (i.e., each bp is sequenced 30 times on average).\n",
      "Such a FASTQ file will contain ~15 million raw 100-bp sequences.\n",
      "To identify the causal genes from this raw data, a variant gene prioritization pipeline usually involves three stages or phases of data processing: 1) raw sequence processing and mapping, 2) variant discovery and genotyping, and 3) disease gene filtering and/or prioritization.\n",
      "Title: Phase 1: Raw sequence processing and mapping\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of Phase 1 is to preprocess the FASTQ file and evaluate the quality of the raw reads and then to map or align the sequences to the reference genome-that is, to find the best location on the reference genome where each sequence might have originated.\n",
      "Successfully mapped sequences are annotated with information that includes the location on a specific chromosome and how well the sequence matches the reference genome.\n",
      "After initial mapping, there are several subsequent recalibration steps to improve the mapping results.\n",
      "Title: Preprocessing\n",
      "\n",
      "The raw FASTQ file contains all of the raw sequences, some of which are of low quality.\n",
      "The overall quality should be evaluated, and the lower-quality reads should be removed before mapping to the reference genome to improve mapping efficiency.\n",
      "FASTQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a popular tool that produces quality analysis reports on FASTQ files.\n",
      "FASTQC provides graphical reports on several useful statistics, such as \"Per base sequence quality,\" \"Sequence duplication levels,\" and \"Overrepresented sequences,\" etc.\n",
      "Specifically, \"Per base sequence quality\" determines if trimming low-quality sequences is needed before the mapping/alignment step; \"Sequence duplication levels\" evaluates the library enrichment and complexity; and \"Overrepresented sequences\" evaluates potential adaptor contamination.\n",
      "Low-quality bases and adaptor contaminations can cause an otherwise mappable sequence not to map and therefore should be removed (e.g., trim the 3' end of the read.\n",
      "which tends to have low quality).\n",
      "FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) provides a set of command line tools for manipulating FASTQ files, such as trimming input sequences down to a fixed length or trimming low-quality bases.\n",
      "Cutadapt (https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt) can be used for trimming short reads to remove potential adapter contamination.\n",
      "Title: Mapping\n",
      "\n",
      "Once high-quality sequence data are obtained, a number of bioinformatics programs, including Mosaik [7], MAQ (http://maq.sourceforge.net/), mrFAST [8], BWA [9], Bowtie2 [10], SOAP2 [11], and Subread [12], can be used to perform short-read sequence alignment to the reference genome.\n",
      "Several recent studies provided a detailed description and comparison of the alignment programs [5, 13], although it could be difficult to choose among aligners, because benchmark results vary across studies [10, 12, 14].\n",
      "BWA and Bowtie2 are two popular programs for alignment.\n",
      "Both programs employ the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) algorithm and have been shown to yield very good overall performance [13].\n",
      "Bowtie2 is often used for mapping ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, and BWA is often used for mapping whole-genome/exome data.\n",
      "We highlight the BWA program here, because it is accurate, fast, thoroughly tested, and well supported.\n",
      "Additionally, BWA has been utilized in multiple large-scale projects and well-defined workflows, including the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) by Broad Institute [15], the 1000 Genome Project [16], the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), and the HugeSeq workflow [17].\n",
      "Various commercial companies, such as Seven Bridges Genomics (https://www.sbgenomics.com/) and Geospiza GeneSifter (http://www.geospiza.com/), also utilize BWA in their standard workflows.\n",
      "After mapping the reads, the final output file from most software is typically in the sequence alignment/map (SAM) format [18].\n",
      "In some cases, the SAM file is converted to its binary format (BAM) using SAMtools [18] to reduce the file size and optimize computation performance.\n",
      "Title: Recalibration\n",
      "\n",
      "After the initial mapping procedure, subsequent recalibration steps are typically employed to improve the mapping results, such as performing local realignment or de novo assembly for regions that contain insertions/deletions (indels), removing PCR duplicates, and recalibrating the base quality scores.\n",
      "Indel realignment is a highly recommended post-BAM processing procedure.\n",
      "Due to the trade-off between speed and accuracy, indels are not well aligned by most general purpose aligners.\n",
      "This could lead to false variant calls in downstream analyses.\n",
      "Regions with high probability of potential indels can be realigned locally using IndelRealigner, part of the GATK toolkit.\n",
      "Another commonly used recalibration procedure is removing PCR duplicates.\n",
      "If a DNA fragment is amplified many times by PCR during the sequencing library construction, these artificially duplicated sequences can be considered as support of a variant by downstream variant discovery programs.\n",
      "Some BAM processing programs, such as Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and Samtools [18], can identify these artificially duplicated sequences and remove them.\n",
      "Base recalibration is also a recommended step, because the sequencer may have assigned a biased quality score upon reading a base (e.g., the score of a second \"A\" base after a first \"A\" base may always receive a biased quality score from a sequence machine [19]).\n",
      "Tools, such as Base-Recalibrator in the GATK toolkit, can calibrate the quality score to more accurately reflect the probability of a base mismatching the reference genome.\n",
      "One additional optional step, recommended by GATK, is data compression and reads reduction, especially for high-coverage data.\n",
      "For example, if a large chunk of sequences matches the reference exactly, it is not necessary to keep all the data, as they do not carry useful information for downstream analyses (assuming we are only interested in the sites that are different from the reference genome).\n",
      "In such a scenario, keeping one copy of each of the consensus sequences may be sufficient, and the redundancies can be removed to reduce file size and enable faster downstream computing.\n",
      "However, keeping a copy of the original file is highly recommended after data compression.\n",
      "Title: Phase 2: Variant discovery and genotyping\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "In many scenarios, only the sites that differ from the reference genome are of interest, because sites that are identical to the reference genome are not expected to be related to pathological conditions.\n",
      "Once raw sequences are properly mapped to the reference genome, the next step is to find all positions in an individual's genome that differed from the reference.\n",
      "This phase is referred to as variant discovery, or variant calling.\n",
      "Similar to the mapping phase, variant calling also contains an initial discovery step, followed by several filtering processes to remove sequencing errors and other types of false discoveries, and finally, the individual genotypes are inferred (i.e., if a locus is heterozygous, homozygous, or hemizygous for the variant).\n",
      "The output of variant calling contains all the variants and related information.\n",
      "Sites that are identical to the reference genome (i.e., invariant sites) are usually not included in the output variant file.\n",
      "Title: Variant discovery and genotyping\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of variant calling software packages can be used to identify variants and call individual genotypes.\n",
      "Some of the commonly used software programs are SAMtools [18], freebayes (http://github.com/ekg/freebayes), SNPtools [20], GATK UnifiedGenotyper, and GATK HaplotypeCaller.\n",
      "Some of the tools, including SAMtools, SNPtools, and the GATK UnifiedGenotyper, use a mapping-based approach.\n",
      "Other tools, such as freebayes and the GATK Haplotype-Caller, use a local assembly approach.\n",
      "A more detailed survey and comparison of the tools have been previously described [5, 21].\n",
      "These procedures typically take the BAM files from the \"raw sequence processing and mapping\" phase, together with the reference genome sequence in a FASTA file.\n",
      "The output file from this step is usually in the standard variant call format (VCF).\n",
      "Some of the tools allow the user to specify known variants to optimize the variant discovery.\n",
      "For example, GATK UnifiedGenotyper uses known variants (e.g., from the dbSNP database) as high-confidence datasets to assist model training.\n",
      "After variant and genotype calling, the probability scores of variants are recalibrated, and artifacts are identified.\n",
      "The artifacts can be removed subsequently either by filtering the data using a series of criteria or by building and applying an error model.\n",
      "One example of the variant discovery tool is the GATK UnifiedGenotyper, which calls variants by examining the reference genome base by base, without correcting misalignment issues.\n",
      "This procedure could lead to false positive calls, particularly in regions containing indels.\n",
      "To increase the accuracy and sensitivity, calling multiple samples simultaneously is recommended.\n",
      "By taking into account the information of a variant in a population, the accuracy and sensitivity of variant discovery are greatly improved, especially for common variants [16, 22].\n",
      "The GATK Haplotype-Caller, as compared to the UnifiedGenotyper, calls all variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], indels, structural variations, etc.)\n",
      "simultaneously by performing local de novo assembly of haplotypes and emits more accurate call sets, with the drawback of being slower.\n",
      "In general, structural variations (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) are more difficult to detect than SNPs and indels because of their heterogeneous nature.\n",
      "For SVs and CNVs, it is generally recommended to apply a combination of several tools and take the overlapping variant sites for high-confidence calls [17].\n",
      "Title: Genotype phasing and refinement\n",
      "\n",
      "After the initial variant discovery and recalibration, variant genotyping and/or phasing are performed to provide critical information for downstream medical and population genetic studies that require accurate haplotype structures.\n",
      "For example, Mendelian diseases may be caused by a compound heterozygote event where heterogeneous mutations are found on different chromosomes.\n",
      "In such a scenario, knowledge about the paternal or maternal origin of a variant can provide valuable information.\n",
      "The GATK workflow recommends three steps of genotype phasing: transmission based on pedigree, haplotype based on reads, and statistical imputation.\n",
      "GATK PhaseByTransmission incorporates pedigree data to assist genotype calling, while GATK Read-BackedPhasing performs physical phasing of variant calling based on sequence reads.\n",
      "Statistical imputation of genotypes can be processed by several programs, such as Beagle [23,24], IMPUTE2 [25], and MACH [26].\n",
      "Title: Phase 3: Disease gene filtering and/or prioritization\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical variant call pipeline will produce approximately 3 million variants from one whole-genome sequencing data set and more than 20 thousand variants from one whole-exome sequencing data set [27].\n",
      "Because disease causing mutations might just be several \"needles\" in this tremendous \"haystack\" of variants, rigorous algorithms and high-quality databases are essential to accurately locate the candidate genes.\n",
      "This process is done either by filtering out variants that are not likely to carry a disease risk or by ranking all variants based on biological/statistical models, such that high-risk candidates rank at the top of the list [1, 2, 4].\n",
      "Unlike Phase 1 and Phase 2, which have largely converged to well-formed computation workflows and platform-free file formats (e.g., FASTQ, BAM, and VCF formats), Phase 3 has more variations in the tools and workflows to suit the different needs of various research or clinical projects.\n",
      "Title: Annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many different strategies can be used to search for disease-causing mutations, some general procedures are shared.\n",
      "The first step, variant annotation, typically investigates the potential pathogenic impact of a variant, before any subsequent filtering or prioritizing.\n",
      "The goal is to identify and report the effect of each variant with respect to predefined \"features,\" such as genes.\n",
      "For example, if a variant (SNP or indel) is present within the coding region, the potential effects include change to amino acid (non-synonymous), no change to amino acid (synonymous), introduction of stop codon (stop gain), removal of stop codon (stop loss), addition/removal of amino-acid(s) (inframe indel), and change to the open reading frame (frame-shifting indel), etc.\n",
      "Other than variant call files, the annotation process requires a feature file that defines the location of genomic features (e.g., transcript, exon, intron, etc.\n",
      "), which is usually in browser extensible data (BED) format [28], or generic feature format version 3 (GFF3) format maintained by the Sequence Ontology project [29].\n",
      "In many situations, the reference genome in FASTA format is also provided as part of the input, and the annotated variants are likely to be platform-specific [30, 31].\n",
      "Annotation is part of the workflow for almost all variant analysis tools, such as the open source software package VAAST [31], ANNOVAR [27], and many commercial service providers (e.g., Ingenuity, Golden Helix, Geospiza GeneSifter, Omicia, Seven Bridges Genomics, Biobase, etc.).\n",
      "Once the variants are annotated, a number of methods can be used to predict the severity of a variant, based either on the protein sequence conservation information (e.g., BLOSOM62, SIFT) or the DNA sequence conservation information (e.g., PhastCons).\n",
      "The SIFT [32] score system assumes that protein \"motifs\" or \"sites\" are functionally important if they are highly conserved across species.\n",
      "For example, coding regions, active sites of enzymes, many splice sites, and promoters are usually conserved across species [32].\n",
      "Technically, SIFT uses protein homology to calculate position-specific scores, which are then used to evaluate if an amino acid substitution at a specific location is damaging or tolerated.\n",
      "The accuracy of the SIFT prediction depends largely on the availability and the diversity of the homologous sequences across species.\n",
      "Therefore, the application and accuracy of SIFT are limited if there is limited homolog information or if the diversity is low.\n",
      "The BLOSUM62 matrix [33] is a more general-purpose score system that is based on the alignment of protein homologs with a maximum of 62% identity.\n",
      "The BLOSUM62 matrix is then calculated based on the count of the observed frequency of specific amino acid substitutions.\n",
      "The PhastCons score [34] is calculated based on DNA sequence conservation in a multiple alignment.\n",
      "It uses a statistical model of sequence evolution and considers the phylogeny relationship of multiple species.\n",
      "Instead of measuring the statistical similarity and diversity in percent identity, PhastCons uses a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model and provides base-by-base conservation scores.\n",
      "Because the PhastCons score is calculated for each base, it can be applied to regions beyond the coding sequence to provide valuable information for prioritizing non-coding variants.\n",
      "In addition to the conservation information, many software packages also incorporate protein structure information, such as the positions of active sites and secondary structures, into the prediction algorithm (e.g., Polyphen2, SNAP).\n",
      "Polyphen2 [35] combines eight sequencing features (e.g., congruency of the variant allele to the multiple alignment) and three structural features (e.g., changes in hydrophobic propensity) to score an amino acid substitution.\n",
      "The homology search and model training of Polyphen2 are based on the UniProt database.\n",
      "It worth noting that Polyphen2 provides two different prediction models that use different datasets for training, with HumVar tuned to score Mendelian diseases and HumDiv tuned to evaluate rare alleles at loci that are potentially involved in complex traits.\n",
      "SNAP [36] is another tool that uses various protein information, such as the secondary structure and conservation, to predict the functional effect of a variant.\n",
      "Title: Filtering\n",
      "\n",
      "After variant annotation, two types of disease-gene identification strategies are commonly employed.\n",
      "A filter-based approach uses a series of criteria to sort out variants or genes that are unlikely to be causative, given a disease model.\n",
      "For example, in a typical workflow of ANNOVAR, variants that overlap with the 1000 Genome Project are removed from the list.\n",
      "Since the 1000 Genome Project aimed to identify common SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 1%, these variants are thought to be \"benign\" in a rare Mendelian disease, under the assumption that the causing mutation of a rare disease should have a very low MAF.\n",
      "The HapMap [37, 38] database, which intended to identify haplotype-defining variants in different populations, can also be used for variant selection.\n",
      "In some cases, high frequency of a haplotype can be related to a specific disease, and can help researchers focus on a subset of variants within a specific region.\n",
      "Another commonly applied filter is to exclude non-coding variants under the assumption that a disease-causing mutation should occur in the coding regions and affect protein sequences.\n",
      "Several other filtering criteria are also commonly used, such as filtering variants with little predicted functional impact (e.g., synonymous variants) or having low-quality scores (e.g., low read-depth or low genotype quality score).\n",
      "A disease model can also help filter variants.\n",
      "For example, a disease under a recessive mode of inheritance requires more than one deleterious variant in a gene.\n",
      "The filtering strategy is intuitive and easy to perform and has been successful in early whole-genome/exome studies on rare, single-gene Mendelian diseases.\n",
      "Numerous tools have been developed to apply various filtering strategies (reviewed in [1, 2, 4, 5]).\n",
      "However, caution should be taken when studying common, complex diseases, because applying hard filters could remove real casual variants.\n",
      "For instance, common diseases could be caused by common variants that have incomplete penetrance (i.e., not all individuals carrying the variant will have the disease).\n",
      "Title: Ranking\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome the difficulties associated with hard filtering, a prioritizing approach ranks each gene or feature based on the cumulative disease risk of potential deleterious variants.\n",
      "As an example, the VAAST tool kit performs the composite likelihood ratio test to determine the risk of a gene or a feature [30, 31].\n",
      "Information of each variant within the gene, such as the predicted biological impact, allele frequency, and the conservation score of the variant allele, is considered simultaneously under a likelihood framework.\n",
      "One advantage is that it reduces the risk of filtering out potential risky coding variants, since there are no hard filtering steps.\n",
      "Another advantage is that it can score all variants, including non-coding variants that would have otherwise been filtered out.\n",
      "The statistical framework used by VAAST considers two sets of information: 1) the likelihood of observing the MAF of a variant under a disease model versus a non-disease model; and 2) the likelihood that a variant is deleterious versus non-deleterious.\n",
      "A combination of the observed frequency and predicted functional impact of variants is used to assess the disease risk of a gene.\n",
      "A practical consideration is that most variants in the sequencing study are rare and may be difficult to achieve sufficient power for a statistical model [39].\n",
      "To overcome this, a common solution is to assess the cumulative effects of multiple variants in a defined genomic region, such as a gene or an exon [39-41].\n",
      "This approach evaluates the overall genetic burden of multiple rare variants and is referred to as the burden test.\n",
      "Two general methods are commonly used to collapse multiple rare variants [40], known as the cohort allelic sum test (CAST) and combined multivariate and collapsing (CMC) method.\n",
      "The CAST method measures the differences (between case group and control group) in the number of individuals who carry one or more rare variants [39, 42], while the CMC method treats all rare variants as a single count for analysis with common variants [39].\n",
      "Since both methods implicitly assume that all variants influence the phenotype in the same direction [39, 40], it could introduce substantial noise if a lot of the rare variants are neutral [40].\n",
      "Alternatives to these two basic methods are also available [40].\n",
      "For example, by default, the VAAST program combines all variants that have less than three copies in a gene into one pseudo-site for scoring.\n",
      "Title: Pathway analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Pathway analysis is an alternative way to search for deleterious genes.\n",
      "The assumption is that a single mutation in a single gene may not be very harmful but that a combination of mutations in several genes causes the disease.\n",
      "In this type of analysis, variants are put in a context of biological processes, pathways, and networks to gain global perspective on the data.\n",
      "A large number of knowledge bases and tools have been developed for this task (reviewed in [43, 44]).\n",
      "In general, pathway systems contain a curation process that is either manual or automatic, followed by database assembly and refinement [43].\n",
      "Many public knowledge base and analysis tools are available, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (http://www.kegg.jp/); BioCyc (http://www.biocyc.org/), provided by SRI international; PANTHER [45]; Reactome [46]; and DAVID [47].\n",

      "Flexibility of pipelines, on the other hand, may be important for researchers who want to have complete control on the pipeline design to fit their projects.\n",
      "In such cases, it is important to have plasticity for users to customize pipelines.\n",
      "For example, a flexible pipeline system should allow users to integrate specific tools that are not part of a general purpose workflow and allow users to supply user-defined control files (e.g., providing a BED file to restrict the variant call within specific regions).\n",
      "There are a number of such pipelines that are well defined and easy to use, such as the GATK pipeline, gkno system (http://gkno.me/), Galaxy [48-50], and VAAST [30, 31].\n",

      "Nevertheless, many challenges remain, and we would like to highlight a few: 1) data standards still need wider agreement.\n",
      "For example, a number of variant discovery tools for SV and CNV use different file formats and need to be converted to the more standard format for downstream analysis [17]; 2) more standardized, automated workflows need to be developed to accommodate different data and projects and minimize the user interaction, such that different research groups can perform independent data analysis and the results can be easily compared; and 3) large, high-quality, and unified databases are essential for disease gene identification/prioritization, and continuous efforts from the scientific community are needed.\n",

      "Various types of large-scale biological datasets have been collected and analyzed with high-throughput technologies, including DNA microarray, next-generation sequencing, and the two-hybrid screening system, for this purpose.\n",
      "In this review, we focus on network-based approaches that help in understanding biological systems and identifying biological functions.\n",
      "Accordingly, this paper covers two major topics in network biology: reconstruction of gene regulatory networks and network-based applications, including protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and network-based genome-wide association study.\n",
      "Network representations have been used to describe interactions between entities of interest in various areas.\n",
      "In particular, network representations are useful to analyze and visualize complex biological activities.\n",
      "Global patterns in a large-scale complex system can be shown by representing the entities and their interactions with nodes and edges, respectively.\n",
      "For instance, Schwikowski et al.\n",
      "[1] created protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to predict novel protein functions in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n",
      "By using the network representations, it was found that 2,358 among 2,709 total interactions compose a single large network.\n",
      "Also, biological pathway databases, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [2] and Reactome [3], provide numerous pathways that are represented by networks with nodes of molecules and directed edges of their actions.\n",
      "In addition, various mathematical properties and models of a network have been developed in graph theory.\n",

      "On the other hand, RegulonDB [20] contains both experimental datasets and computational prediction results of transcriptional regulatory interactions for the Escherichia coli K-12 organism.\n",
      "From the advances of high-throughput technologies, large-scale networks have been identified and are available from various public databases, as summarized in Table 1.\n",
      "In this section, we focus on network-based applications, especially how to use previously identified network resources in order to obtain meaningful biological interpretations.\n",
      "We first introduce three basic concepts in graph theory [53] to give an overview of the basic concepts of the network-based methods.\n",
      "First, a neighborhood of a node is a set of nodes connected to the node.\n",
      "Second, the distance between two nodes is defined as a length of the shortest path between them if the path exists; otherwise, it is set to infinity.\n",
      "Finally, an adjacency matrix is a binary and symmetric matrix such that its ij-th element is equal to 1 if there is an edge from a node i to a node j; otherwise, it is 0.\n",
      "In some cases, a weighted adjacency matrix can be used to represent the strengths of edges that usually fall between 0 and 1.\n",
      "With these basic concepts, we introduce three network-based applications: protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and genome-wide association study.\n",
      "Title: Protein function prediction\n",
      "\n",
      "With the results of sequencing genomes, the efforts to predict protein functions have been focused on the functionalities of genomic annotations.\n",
      "In the initial stage, the prediction of protein function begins with the sequence homologies to annotated proteins [54-57].\n",
      "These methods have been successful, but 70% of proteins still remain unannotated [58].\n",
      "Accordingly, various types of methods have been developed to characterize unannotated proteins.\n",
      "In this review, we introduce four approaches in protein function prediction, based on direct interactions in the network: neighborhood-based, graph-based, Bayesian, and Kernel-based approaches.\n",
      "The methods are summarized in Table 3 [10, 11, 13-16, 59-83].\n",
      "In neighborhood-based approach, the proposed methods [1, 62, 63, 65] commonly consider the number of edges connected to annotated proteins in a neighborhood.\n",
      "The neighborhood counting method [1] only takes into account the frequencies of annotated proteins in the neighborhood and chooses the top three functions, with the calculated frequencies ranked in descending order for each protein.\n",
      "Other methods also have derived their own scores, such as χ2 statistics [62] and functional similarities [63, 65], based on the annotated protein information in the neighborhood.\n",
      "These methods choose a function with the highest score as a predicted function for each protein.\n",
      "The graph-based approach is similar to the neighborhood-based approach, but the graph-based approach focuses more on how to label the unannotated proteins with graph theoretical properties, such as the distance and the adjacency matrix.\n",
      "The label assignment models have been proposed with the adjacency matrix [66] and the weighted adjacency matrix [67], respectively.\n",
      "Since these assignment problems are computationally intractable, the heuristic methods, such as the simple threshold rule or simulated annealing [84], have been applied.\n",
      "To avoid these computational problems, several propagation-flavored methods have been developed.\n",
      "First, the label propagation methods [69, 70] obtain the optimal assignments and the optimal combination of the weight matrices that reflects different types of networks.\n",
      "Second, the functional flow method [68] iteratively spreads the flow from the annotated protein to the unannotated proteins by connected edges.\n",
      "The functional flow score, defined as an amount of the flow, is the criterion of the prediction.\n",
      "Third, the sequential linear neighborhood propagation method [71] sequentially updates unlabeled proteins according to their shortest path distance to the set of labeled proteins.\n",
      "Finally, the neighbor relativity coefficient (NRC) method [72] derives the NRC score by integrating various graph topological properties, such as the shortest path distance, path connectivity, and common neighbors.\n",
      "The Bayesian approach takes into account the posterior probabilities of binary label random variables to obtain the prediction from the observed network and annotated proteins.\n",
      "Markov random field (MRF)-based [85] methods [74, 75] have been proposed and modified to Bayesian MRF [77] recently.\n",
      "To predict protein functions, these methods commonly derive the marginal posterior probability of the binary label variable given other variables and then estimate the posterior probability by Gibbs sampling.\n",
      "In addition to MRF-based models, other probabilistic models [78-80] have been developed under hierarchical structures from gene ontology [64]-which provides gene product annotation data that are characterized into three categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions-with some models, such as the hierarchical binomial neighborhood model [79].\n",
      "In particular, Jiang et al.\n",
      "[80] considered the auto-probit model with a weighted network information from STRING [16], and their auto-probit model also reflects the uncertainty of the annotation [64].\n",
      "The Kernel-based approach considers the protein function prediction problem as a classification problem.\n",
      "To reflect network information into the classification state, the network information is converted into a kernel matrix.\n",
      "Lanckriet et al.\n",
      "[81] proposed the kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) method, which incorporates heterogeneous types of data, such as amino acid sequence, gene expression data, and PPI network data, by converting these data into kernel matrices.\n",
      "The SVM method can be reformulated as semi-definite programming (SDP) [86] with kernels.\n",
      "Although the SVM method performs well, this method becomes slow when the dimension increases, caused by the computational complexity of the SDP.\n",
      "To remedy this problem, Lee et al.\n",
      "[82] proposed the kernel-based logistic regression (KLR) method by combing MRF-based methods [74, 75] with the diffusion kernel [87].\n",
      "The KLR can contain multiple functions and various types of datasets at once.\n",
      "It has been shown that the KLR method is faster than the SVM and is comparable to the SVM in prediction accuracy [82].\n",
      "Recently, Wang et al.\n",
      "[83] proposed the function-function correlated multi-label method, which treats all function categories in the prediction at once, while other methods only consider one function at a time, except for KLR.\n",
      "Title: Disease gene prioritization\n",
      "\n",
      "Disease-gene association studies have focused on identifying relationships between disease phenotypes and genes to reveal and understand human disease mechanisms.\n",
      "Although traditional approaches, including linkage analysis and association studies, have been successful, the specified genomic intervals often contain tens or even hundreds of genes.\n",
      "It may not be possible by experiments to identify the correct causative genes of all the genes that lie on the specified intervals.\n",
      "To reduce experimental costs and efforts, the prioritization of candidate genes becomes one of the major tasks in disease-gene association studies.\n",
      "Taking into consideration that genes corresponding to similar disease phenotypes tend to be neighbors in either a PPI network [88, 89] or a pathway [90], several network-based disease gene prioritization methods have been proposed recently.\n",
      "The network-based disease gene prioritization methods [91-94] define different similarity scores between the disease and genes, based on either functional annotations or PPI networks, to rank candidate genes.\n",
      "The random walk method [91] considers the random walk on graphs and uses a diffusion kernel matrix [87] derived from a PPI network as the steady-state transition probability matrix.\n",
      "The random walk method then defines the similarity score as the sum of elements of the diffusion kernel corresponding to known disease genes for each candidate gene.\n",
      "CIPHER [92] adopts a regression model for similarities between phenotypes and considers the Gaussian kernel for closeness between genes.\n",
      "The Pearson correlation coefficient between the similarity of phenotypes and the closeness between genes is used as a similarity score.\n",
      "On the other hand, PRINCE [93] and MINProp [94] are based on the iterative label propagation algorithm [95].\n",
      "PRINCE defines the prioritization function, which combines functional similarities from the network information with prior information for disease phenotypes as the similarity score.\n",
      "The prioritization function is obtained by iteratively applying a label propagation algorithm.\n",
      "MINProp first defines two heterogeneous networks, such as a gene network and a disease network, and then additionally defines bipartite networks between two heterogeneous networks from known disease-gene associations.\n",
      "After initializing the labels of the disease genes, MINProp iteratively propagates label information through three networks until convergence occurs.\n",
      "Finally, the converged label scores are used as the similarity scores.\n",
      "From the comparison study in [93, 94], PRINCE and MINProp outperform the random walk and CIPHER methods, respectively.\n",
      "There is no comparison study between PRINCE and MINProp, but MINProp is more general than PRINCE, since MINProp can be applied to three or more heterogeneous networks.\n",
      "We report these disease gene prioritization methods with their data resources in Table 4 [12, 13, 15-18, 91-94, 96-99].\n",
      "Title: Genome-wide association study (GWAS)\n",
      "\n",
      "The GWAS measures DNA sequence variations in the human genome to identify associations between genetic variants and diseases (or phenotypes).\n",
      "To measure genetic variations, the single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which represents a single base-pair change in the DNA sequence, is generally used as a marker of a genomic region in the GWAS.\n",
      "Generally, the GWAS conducts a comparison of the SNPs between case and control groups (i.e., disease and non-disease groups) by statistical methods, such as ANOVA and logistic regression, to identify significant SNPs related to the disease.\n",
      "Genetic risk factors revealed by a GWAS can be used as preventive markers or for therapeutic targets in curing the disease.\n",
      "There have been more than 11,000 SNPs discovered as candidate bio-markers in common diseases [100].\n",
      "The large number of SNPs detectable in the human genome can, however, lead to multiple testing problems.\n",
      "To control the false positive errors (i.e., type I errors in the context of statistical testing procedures), the Bonferroni correction and false discovery rate [101] methods are commonly adopted.\n",
      "Although these multiple testing rules have been successful in the identification of significant single SNPs, these test procedures often fail to detect genomic regions that are weakly associated with the disease and still ignore the combined effects caused by the interactions between genes.\n",
      "The network-based GWAS methods [102-104], summarized in Table 5 [12, 13, 17, 102-114], take into account both interactions between genes or proteins with association information available from a GWAS.\n",
      "The HumanNet method [115] combines functional gene networks derived from multiple network sources, such as the PPI network, and mRNA co-expression with the log odds ratio from GWAS data to prioritize disease genes.\n",
      "By combining functional gene networks and the information from GWAS data, HumanNet has higher power to detect disease-related genes.\n",
      "Unlike HumanNet, NIMMI [116] and dmGWAS [117] focus on identifying groups of genes associated with diseases, based on GWAS data and PPI network data.\n",
      "NIMMI constructs a PPI network with weights of genes by using a modified Google PageRank algorithm [118].\n",
      "The weights of genes are then combined with the gene-based association p-values calculated from GWAS data.\n",
      "The subnetworks of genes are identified by the DAVID method [119, 120] with the network structure and weights of genes.\n",
      "On the other hand, dmGWAS only considers gene-based association p-values as the node weights and proposes a modified version of the dense module searching method [121] to prioritize candidate groups of genes.\n",
      "We have reviewed a number of methods related to two topics in network data analysis: network reconstruction and network-based application.\n",
      "Network reconstruction can be thought of as a reverse-engineering problem whose goal is to rebuild true structures or relationships from observations.\n",
      "In particular, we focused on statistical methods for building GRNs, including the Gaussian graphical model, correlation network, Bayesian network, and information theory-based methods.\n",
      "Most methods that we have reviewed consider the sparsity on the graph structure to select a small number of significant dependencies between nodes.\n",
      "This sparsity condition is adequate for the network in biological systems, since it reflects a scale-free feature, where several nodes have many edges but the majority of nodes only has three or four edges [5].\n",
      "Although most methods in Gaussian graphical models are well studied in their theoretical properties, these methods have limitations when applied to biological data.\n",
      "Since these methods basically assume a Gaussian distribution, they are only applicable for continuous-type datasets, such as gene expression levels.\n",
      "To construct networks from other types of data, such as binary or counts, the Bayesian network and information theory-based methods are more attractive than correlation-based methods.\n",
      "Second, we introduced various methods in three network-based applications.\n",
      "Most methods consider similarity measures between nodes and then use these measures to predict biological functions or prioritize candidate genes associated with diseases.\n",
      "As technologies in the experiments progress, the network-based methods can be improved and widely extended.\n",
      "For instance, even though the neighborhood counting method [1] in protein function prediction only considers the count of annotated functions in the neighborhood from a PPI network, the recently developed methods [72, 83] can contain not only neighborhood information but also functional similarities from multiple networks.\n",
      "In addition, module-assisted methods that focus on identifying a functional group of proteins are also available and well summarized in [122].\n",
      "Furthermore, the network-based tumor stratification (NBS) method has been developed recently [123].\n",
      "This NBS method combines mutation profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects [116, 117, 124, 125] and network information to obtain informative strata (e.g., subtypes of cancer).\n",
      "Although these network-based methods have been improved, these methods still lack accuracy compared with other methods [115].\n",
      "Since the high-throughput data may contain many false positives [126], the network-based methods are affected in their accuracy.\n",
      "Although their performance depends on the quality of data, their effects are expected to decrease in the future as improvements are made in measurement accuracy.\n",

      "This report provides a review of biobanks, including Korean biobanks and an analysis of sample volumes, regulations, policies, and ethical issues of the biobank.\n",
      "Until now, the top 6 countries according to the number of large-scale biobanks are the United Kingdom, United States, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, and there is one major National Biobank of Korea (NBK) and 17 regional biobanks in Korea.\n",
      "Many countries have regulations and guidelines for the biobanks, and the importance of good management of biobanks is increasing.\n",
      "Meanwhile, according to a first survey of 456 biobank managers in the United States, biobankers are concerned with the underuse of the samples in their repositories, which need to be advertised for researchers.\n",
      "Korea Biobank Network (KBN) project phase II (2013-2015) was also planned for the promotion to use biospecimens in the KBN.\n",
      "The KBN is continuously introducing for researchers to use biospecimens in the biobank.\n",
      "An accreditation process can also be introduced for biobanks to harmonize collections and encourage use of biospecimens in the biobanks.\n",
      "KBN is preparing an on-line application system for the distribution of biospecimens and a biobank accreditation program and is trying to harmonize the biobanks.\n",
      "Biobanks provide important materials for many research realms, such as biomarker development for the early diagnoses of specific diseases, including cancer and genetic diseases, and for applying personalized drug therapies.\n",
      "There is no consensus definition for a biobank, but it is considered a biorepository that stores biospecimens for use for diagnostic or research purposes.\n",
      "Also, a biobank is an institution that collects, stores, processes, and uses biological materials, genetic data, and associated epidemiological data from human beings or distributes them to researchers [1].\n",
      "The term \"research biobank\" means a collection of human biological material and data obtained directly by the analysis of this material, which is used or is to be used for research purposes [2].\n",
      "A repository is defined as an organization, place, room, or physical entity that may receive, process, store, maintain, and/or distribute specimens, their derivatives, and their associated data.\n",

      "A total of 5,209 persons between the age of 30 and 62 from Framingham, Massachusetts participated in this study, and three generations of participants (for a total of almost 15,000 participants) were recruited; the researchers began clinical examinations and lifestyle-related interviews to seek risk factors related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) development.\n",
      "FHS has revealed the significant identification of the main CVD risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, and obesity, as well as immense information on factors, such as blood triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, age, and so on [3].\n",
      "By the late 1990s, scientists realized that some diseases originated from a single defective gene, but most genetic diseases are caused by multiple genetic factors on multiple genes [4].\n",
      "For an understanding of whole-genome information of humans, the Human Genome Project (HGP) was begun in 1990, and the human genome was completely released in 2003.\n",
      "Owing to the increased demands on qualified biospecimens for research, the number of biobanks has increased significantly between 1980 and 1999 worldwide [5].\n",
      "Many countries, including the European countries, Japan, and Korea, have established large-scale biobanks to collect a large quantity of patient specimens from over 200,000 people, based on their population and/or on their disease-oriented groups (Table 1).\n",

      "In 1995, the Ministry of Education and Science Technology established the Korea National Research Resource Centers for collecting various bioresources.\n",
      "However, the scale and variety of the collections were lacking, because collections were based on an individual research project.\n",
      "The Ministry of Environment established biobanks, but their samples were limited to specimens needed for the research of environmentally induced diseases.\n",
      "Therefore, there was a necessity to establish a biobank that was centered on hospitals for collecting human biospecimens [12].\n",
      "In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Welfare started the Korea Biobank Project (KBP) and tried to support establishing biobanks within university-affiliated general hospitals as well as creating a network among these biobanks, including National Biobank of Korea (NBK), which is the largest national biorepository in Korea, located in Osong, the central region in South Korea [13, 14].\n",

      "In general, pure preparations of DNA and RNA have an OD260/OD280 of 1.8 and 2.0 respectively.\n",
      "LCL quality assurance was also conducted, and 10% of the stocked LCL was randomly selected to undergo survival rate investigation and cross-contamination test in the NBK [13].\n",
      "Informed consent is getting a patient to sign a written consent form and is the process of communication between a patient and a medical doctor.\n",

      "Informed consent can be given based on a clear understanding of the process, implications, and consequences of an action.\n",

      "Explanations should be on confidentiality, participants' rights of withdrawal, and specifications [20].\n",
      "Due to the difficulties of securing specific informed consent, broad consent is a more general form of consent in which individuals agree to have their biosamples and personal information collected and stored in the biobank and for future, unspecified research [21].\n",
      "Further issues have been discussed recently, such as privacy, confidentiality and data protection, controlling data access, accessibility to biospecimens, benefit sharing, commercialization, intellectual property rights, and genetic discrimination [22].\n",
      "In order to ensure bioethics and bioethical safety in the life sciences and biotechnologies, each of the institutions should set up its own Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n",
      "When a genetic testing or research institution obtains written informed consent from a test subject concerning the use of specimens for research purposes, it may provide the specimens to either a person conducting research on genes or an institution licensed to open a biobank in Korea [1].\n",
      "In Korea, the Bioethics and Safety Act was completely revised to reinforce research ethics, including biobanks, and the law took effect in 2013.\n",
      "The number of biobanks within university-affiliated hospitals will increase.\n",
      "This law encourages biobanks to strengthen ethical use of biospecimens, and the law assesses biobanks' responsibility to obtain informed consent from donors and is supervised by the IRB.\n",
      "The law also encourages individual researchers to deposit and use biospecimens at any biobank instead of collecting their own sample collection and distribution processes [1, 14].\n",
      "Many biobanks have policies for the distribution of biospecimens and data.\n",
      "For example, there is a guideline to distribute biospecimens in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.\n",
      "NHANES's biospecimens are representative samples of Americans and should not be used for the independent case-control study, and 1individual vial must be stored permanently.\n",
      "All proposals for the use of NHANES samples are evaluated by a technical panel for scientific merit and by the NHANES Ethics Review Board (ERB).\n",
      "To determine if this limited resource should be used in the proposed projects, a technical panel will evaluate the public health significance and scientific merit of the proposed research.\n",
      "Distribution of a 0.5-mL sample is available once, and after finishing the research, the remaining samples are abandoned, or remnants more than 0.3 mL should be returned to NHANES; third-party biospecimen transfer is not permitted.\n",
      "Researchers who received specimens must submit the result of the analysis, such as quality control and analytical methods with documents, to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).\n",
      "Surplus data without DNA analysis results would be opened in the website and given a period of 3 months for analysis.\n",
      "A researcher's intellectual property rights are not permitted because of research for public health (http://www/cdc/gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).\n",
      "The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) biorepository in the United States has 2.9 million biological samples, including blood, and researchers can use samples and data through the process of peer review.\n",
      "Researchers can submit summarized proposals to the PLCO, and the chosen research is recommended for full research proposals and submissions are available twice in June/July or December/January annually.\n",
      "The review process takes 4 or 6 months.\n",
      "Researchers with approved proposals should submit IRB approval documents and contract the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) mutually, and biospecimens are distributed to researchers when approved; researchers should report experimental results to Information Management Systems (IMS) (http://www.plcostars.com).\n",
      "At present, distribution of biospecimens is available to Korean researchers irrespective of research funds, and the distribution for data is accessible to Korean researchers without financial sponsors in Korean biobanks.\n",
      "All proposals for distribution of data and biospecimens should be reviewed and be approved by the IRB belonging to an institute prior to submission.\n",
      "Opened data and biospecimens for distribution in the NBK are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\n",
      "First of all, researchers who want to receive the data and biospecimens have to submit the application document to the NBK.\n",
      "The submitted documents will be reviewed, and a board meeting for distribution is held monthly; distribution of work for the approved application will be performed approximately within one or two months from submission of the application documents for distribution.\n",
      "NBK is planning a website for the distribution process.\n",
      "Most of the distributed biospecimens are DNA samples in the NBK, and a few body fluid samples, including sera and plasma, were distributed.\n",
      "According to the advancement of the technology, the minimum quantity for clinical examination and for the analysis of metabolites is diminishing.\n",
      "However, sera and plasma are very limited resources, and political decisions and long-term planning for the use of body fluid samples will be needed [12].\n",
      "In 2000, following the HGP, biological research moved into the so-called genomic era.\n",
      "Diseases have been studied by identifying genes and their specific function and understanding the role played by genetics in the beginning and prognosis of diseases, and an advanced world of medicine, known as \"personalized medicine,\" has been initiated [5].\n",
      "Accessibility to human specimens and data for the purposes of research is important for realms, such as genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, molecular imaging, and nanotechnology [23].\n",
      "There are genetic factors that affect susceptibility to common diseases [24].\n",
      "These diseases may have several genetic risk factors that influence each other, and interact with the environment, and this has spurred the development of large-scale biobanking projects to identify susceptible genes [25].\n",
      "Despite intensive research over the last decade, most of the genetic basis of common human diseases remains unknown.\n",
      "The identification of meaningful genetic variants, genes, and pathways involved in special diseases offers a potential route to new therapies, improved diagnosis, and better disease prevention.\n",
      "For some time, it has been hoped that the advent of GWASs would provide a successful new tool for solving the genetic basis of many of these common causes of human morbidity and mortality.\n",
      "Advances in sequencing technology enabled us to sequence the whole human genome [26, 27].\n",
      "The use of WGS of large patient cohorts is a much-needed approach in researching complex traits; it is still being ruled out to detect low-frequency genetic variants, due to its high costs [28, 29].\n",
      "Among the new and emerging fields of research is proteomics, the study of the full set of proteins encoded by the genome.\n",
      "Also, proteomics is strongly associated with the discovery phase, the first step in the process chain to create diagnostic content [30].\n",
      "Due to the increased demands on qualified biospecimens for research, the number of biobanks has significantly increased recently.\n",
      "By virtue of the advancements in bioinformatics and biotechnology, storing biospecimens and data on a large scale requires that biobanks harmonize biobank processes and regulations [5].\n",
      "Most biobanks did their best to secure more biospecimens at the inception of the foundation and comparably distribution rate for the researchers is low.\n",
      "According to a first survey of 456 biobank managers in the United States, nearly 70% of those questioned were concerned with underuse of the samples in their repositories [31].\n",
      "Therefore, many biobankers are trying to advertise their biospecimens to researchers in regional academic societies.\n",
      "Like the United States, the NBK has faced a similar situation for the underuse of biospecimens stored in the biobank.\n",
      "In the first phase of the KBP (2008-2012), biobanks concentrated on securing facilities, such as storage equipment, as well as securing manpower and funding for biobanks.\n",
      "However, in the second phase (2013-2015), more R&D projects are needed that support clinicians, so that it will be possible to gather resources with more information.\n",
      "For maximizing the value of biospecimens, consistency in the methods by which they are retrieved, processed, stored, and transported is important.\n",
      "Ideally, this should involve the use of agreed SOPs in general [32].\n",
      "The other issue in the next big step is automated biobanking, and today's biobanks demand and move toward automated sample management systems that meet the requirements for reliability, sample integrity, high capacity, and high throughput.\n",
      "Horn, the former director of the Genetic Alliance, demonstrates that biobanks have to cooperate together to achieve their mission, and standardization is going to be important for researchers to get samples from different collections; we need catalogs that say where these samples exist [33].\n",
      "Accreditation processes can also be introduced to biobanks for harmonizing collections and encouraging use of biospecimens in the biobanks, including the KBN.\n",
      "The NBK is also preparing an online distribution portal for the convenient application of distribution to researchers and preparing a biobank accreditation program; these will harmonize the biobanks in Korea.\n",

      "The rapid advances in genetic knowledge and technology raise various, sometimes unprecedented, ethical dilemmas in the scientific community as well as the public realm.\n",
      "To deal with these dilemmas, the international community has prepared and issued ethical standards in various formats.\n",
      "In this review, seven international standards regarding genetics and genomics will be briefly introduced in chronological order.\n",
      "Critical reflections on them will not be provided in this review, and naturally, they have their own problems and shortcomings.\n",

      "Title: Recently, there was a very unique bio-art exhibition by New York-based artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, titled \"Stranger Visions\" [1].\n",
      "She collected samples from discarded chewing gum, strands of hair, and cigarette butts around New York City.\n",
      "She took these items to Genspace, a do-it-yourself community biology laboratory, where DNA was extracted from each of the objects.\n",
      "By sequencing specific genomic regions and cross-referencing the results with published data, she was able to create 3-dimensional (3D) sculpted portraits of her anonymous donors using a 3D printer.\n",
      "She said that this work is designed to stimulate a cultural dialog about genetic surveillance.\n",
      "However, this provocative art project surely raises a question: Is it ethical?\n",
      "To find an answer to this question, as a starting point, it would be helpful to review some major conventions, resolutions, declarations, or guidelines issued by international public organizations, such as the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); and the Council of Europe.\n",
      "These norms have been providing the principles and recommendations that guide the member states in their legislation and policy.\n",
      "They are worth reviewing, because, as Marie Curie once wrote, \"science is essentially international.\"\n",
      "Knowledge, technologies, and money-capital and research fund-in the bioscience field cross borders freely and very quickly.\n",
      "In this review, seven international standards relevant to genetics and genomics will be introduced briefly in chronological order with some background information, and the possible answer to the questions with regard to the bio-art project will be provided after that.\n",
      "In July 1990, just a couple of months before the Human Genome Project (HGP) officially began, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) held the conference, titled \"Genetics, Ethics, and Human Values: Human Genome Mapping, Genetic Screening, and Therapy,\" in Tokyo and in Inuyama City, Japan.\n",
      "The Conference was co-sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNESCO.\n",
      "Here, the Conference produced the Declaration consisting of eight statements.\n",
      "The following information is the main content of the Declaration [2].\n",
      "The Conference agreed that the HGP would present no inherent ethical problems but was concerned about genetic testing, which would be available through the project, since the identification and sequencing of new genes can expand the scope for diagnostic tests.\n",
      "The Declaration emphasizes the importance of the welfare of the person tested and the confidentiality of the test results.\n",
      "For this, adequate genetic counseling is recommended.\n",
      "Also, the Declaration requires that the needs of developing countries should obtain their due share of the benefits that ensue from the HGP.\n",
      "Title: Regarding gene therapy, the Declaration states that it should be limited to conditions that cause significant disability and not employed simply to enhance or suppress cosmetic, behavioral, or cognitive traits that are not related to any recognized human disease.\n",
      "Regarding germ-line gene therapy, the Declaration states that 'continued discussion of both its technical and ethical aspects is essential and that, before germ-line therapy is undertaken, its safety must be well established, for changes in germ cells would affect the descendants of patients.'\n",
      "The Declaration acknowledges public concern about the growth of genetic knowledge, which is partly caused by a misconception: the genetic knowledge reveals an essential aspect of humanness (i.e., genetic essentialism); it may reduce human beings to mere base pairs of DNA (i.e., genetic reductionism).\n",
      "To correct this misconception, the Declaration recommends education of the public and open discussion.\n",
      "To ensure the setting and observance of ethical standards, continuous multidisciplinary and transcultural dialog and ethical sensitivity in policy-making are recommended.\n",
      "The Declaration, consisting of 6 sections and 25 articles, was adopted unanimously on November 11, 1997 and endorsed by the UN General Assembly on December 9, 1998.\n",
      "Its Guidelines for the implementation were also endorsed on November 16, 1999.\n",
      "The aims of the Declaration are to promote and develop ethical studies and the actions arising out of them on the consequences of scientific and technological progress in the fields of biology and genetics, within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n",
      "UNESCO recognizes that research on the human genome and the resulting applications open up vast prospects for progress in improving the health of individuals and of humankind as a whole.\n",
      "However, it emphasizes that such research should fully respect human dignity, freedom, and human rights, as well as the prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on genetic characteristics.\n",
      "The following information is the main content of the Declaration [5].\n",
      "The Declaration covers the issues of human dignity, the human genome, research on the human genome, conditions for the exercise of scientific activity, solidarity, and international cooperation, etc.\n",
      "Article 1 states that the human genome underlies the fundamental unity of all members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diversity.\n",
      "It even declares that the human genome is the heritage of humanity in a symbolic sense.\n",
      "Article 2 prohibits genetic discrimination and states that human dignity makes it imperative not to reduce individuals to their genetic characteristics and to respect their uniqueness and diversity.\n",
      "Article 3 acknowledges that the human genome can be expressed differently according to each individual's natural and social environment, including the individual's state of health, living conditions, nutrition, and education, rejecting genetic determinism.\n",
      "Article 4 declares that the human genome in its natural state shall not give rise to financial gains.\n",
      "Article 10 affirms that no research or research applications concerning the human genome should prevail over respect for the human rights, fundamental freedoms, and human dignity of individuals or of groups of people.\n",
      "Article 11 prohibits practices that are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, but there is no mention of therapeutic cloning.\n",
      "The Declaration consists of five sections and 27 articles and seems to be more relevant to researchers in the fields of genetics and genomics than the other six standards.\n",
      "The aim of this Declaration is to ensure the respect of human dignity and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the collection, processing, use, and storage of human genetic data, human proteomic data, and of the biological samples from which they are derived, in keeping with the requirements of equality, justice, and solidarity, while giving due consideration to freedom of thought and expression, including freedom of research.\n",
      "It is also very relevant today, since the importance of human genetic data for economic and commercial purposes increases and the growing amount of personal data collected makes genuine irretrievability increasingly difficult.\n",
      "The following is the content of the Declaration [6].\n",
      "This Declaration covers various practical issues: withdrawal of consent; the right to know or right not to know of research results; access to his or her own data; privacy and confidentiality; circulation and international cooperation; sharing of benefits; storage and destruction; and cross-matching.\n",
      "Article 4 describes that human genetic data have a special status on account of their sensitive nature: they can be predictive of genetic predispositions concerning individuals, and the power of predictability can be stronger than assessed at the time of deriving the data; they may have a significant impact on the family, including offspring, extending over generations, and in some instances on the whole group; they may contain information, the significance of which is not known at the time of the collection of biological samples; and they may have cultural significance for persons or groups.\n",
      "Article 7 requires that every effort should be made to ensure that human genetic data and human proteomic data are not used in a way that leads to discrimination or stigmatization.\n",
      "In this regard, appropriate attention should be paid to the findings of population-based genetic studies and behavioral genetic studies and their interpretations.\n",
      "Article 19 emphasizes the need to share the benefits resulting from the use of human genetic and proteomic data or biological samples collected for medical and scientific research.\n",
      "It describes the various forms of benefits: special assistance to the persons and groups that have taken part in the research; access to medical care; provision of new diagnostics, facilities for new treatments, or drugs stemming from the research; support for health services; capacity-building facilities for research purposes; and development and strengthening of the capacity of developing countries to collect and process human genetic data.\n",
      "It was the first time in the history of bioethics that member states committed themselves and the international community to respect and apply the fundamental principles of bioethics set forth within a single text consisting of 28 articles.\n",
      "This Declaration addresses ethical issues related to medicine, life sciences, and associated technologies as applied to human beings, taking into account their social, legal, and environmental dimensions.\n",
      "The aims of this Declaration include: to recognize the importance of freedom of research and the benefits derived from scientific and technological developments, while stressing the need for such research and developments to occur within the framework of ethical principles; to respect human dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedoms; to safeguard and promote the interests of the present and future generations; and to underline the importance of biodiversity and its conservation as a common concern of humankind.\n",
      "The following information is the content of the Declaration that is relevant to genetics and genomics [7].\n",
      "Article 16 emphasizes the impact of life sciences on future generations, including their genetic constitution.\n",
      "To protect the environment, the biosphere, and biodiversity, Article 17 encourages to pay due regard to the interconnection between human beings and other forms of life, to the importance of appropriate access and utilization of biological and genetic resources, to respect for traditional knowledge, and to the role of human beings.\n",
      "Article 21 requires that, in transnational practices, States should take appropriate measures, both at the national and international levels, to combat bioterrorism and illicit traffic in organs, tissues, samples, genetic resources, and genetic-related materials.\n",
      "However, some experts criticize the process of drafting the Declaration, which excluded a necessary group of stakeholders, and claim that the Declaration therefore fails to provide the guidance that can be readily applied in different settings [8].\n",
      "Although there are more international norms besides the seven standards introduced in this article and will be more, a set of currently recognized, common ethical principles regarding genetics and genomics can be drawn from these standards (Table 1).\n",
      "There are hardly any clashes over the main principles or attitudes towards the human genome among these norms.\n",
      "Small differences, which are mostly found in details, have resulted from adding new principles and details, rather than changing or negating the previously declared principles.\n",
      "Keeping these principles in mind, let us go back to Dewey-Hagborg's project.\n",
      "The action concerned is the genetic testing of abandoned DNA without the donor's consent.\n",
      "Did the artist violate their human rights, especially fundamental freedom, by testing their genomes without consent?\n",
      "Since the artist does not know their identity, she could not obtain their consent.\n",
      "One protocol provides ideas for cases when it is not possible to contact a person for a genetic test.\n",
      "It says that the law may allow the test to be carried out when the testing is for the benefit of family member(s) on his or her biological material previously sampled for another purpose and when the expected benefit cannot be otherwise obtained and where the test cannot be deferred [9].\n",
      "Therefore, Dewey-Hagborg's action seems unlikely to be justified.\n",
      "In addition, from a legal perspective, New York's law outlaws most DNA testing without written consent, and the United Kingdom also outlawed non-consensual DNA testing in 2006.\n",
      "However, the legal status of DNA retrieved in the environment is uncertain in many jurisdictions.\n",
      "Another important question is whether the testing infringed their privacy.\n",
      "Since the individuals concerned are unlikely to be recognizable from the sculptures, the artist argues that her project does not invade privacy.\n",
      "Then, what if it is technically possible to identify the donor or is possible in the near future?\n",
      "Does it change the nature of the action?\n",
      "To all these questions, there may not be one correct answer at all or there can be many alternative answers to each question.\n",
      "For most ethical dilemmas, the first step to find good answers to them is to have ethical sensitivity-the ability to perceive ethical problems as ethical problems.\n",
      "After that, continuous, open, multidisciplinary, transcultural dialog will greatly help our journey, and our colleagues will be very reliable companions.\n",

      "Title: Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), Its Ligands, and Soluble RAGE: Potential Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Targets for Human Renal Diseases\n",
      "\n",
      "Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor that is able to bind several different ligands, including advanced glycation endproducts, high-mobility group protein (B)1 (HMGB1), S-100 calcium-binding protein, amyloid-β-protein, Mac-1, and phosphatidylserine.\n",
      "Its interaction is engaged in critical cellular processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and migration, and dysregulation of RAGE and its ligands leads to the development of numerous human diseases.\n",
      "In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways regulated by RAGE and its ligands identified up to date and demonstrate the effects of hyper-activation of RAGE signals on human diseases, focused mainly on renal disorders.\n",
      "Finally, we propose that RAGE and its ligands are the potential targets for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of numerous renal diseases.\n",
      "Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily [1].\n",
      "As its name implicates, it can bind to advanced glycation endproducts, the resulting product of non-enzymatic glycosylation [2], and it also has the ability to interact with multiple ligands having common motifs as a so-called multi-ligand receptor.\n",
      "The ligands include high-mobility group protein (B)1 (HMGB1), S-100 calcium-binding protein, amyloid-β-protein, Mac-1, and phosphatidylserine [3].\n",
      "Interaction between RAGE and its ligands activates various cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and migration [4].\n",
      "Expression of RAGE is different, depending on the organ, developmental stage, and cellular condition [5].\n",
      "It is highly expressed during the embryonic stage, whereas it is mostly kept at low levels in adults [5, 6].\n",
      "Mostly, it is stimulated by cellular stresses, such as inflammation, and is therefore easily found to be abnormally over-expressed in many human chronic diseases [7].\n",
      "Accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) is highly associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes, which causes serious consequences on metabolic systems [8].\n",
      "In addition, expression of S100 proteins is reported to be involved in many cancers, including breast, lung, kidney, and thyroid cancers.\n",
      "Mostly, their up-regulation promotes tumorigenesis by stimulating metastasis through the activation of relevant transcription factors or by acting as chemoattractants [9, 10].\n",
      "In addition to cancers, RAGE and its ligands are abnormally regulated in various types of chronic immune diseases, such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and arthritis [7].\n",
      "Increasing evidence demonstrates the critical role of RAGE signaling in many other human diseases and suggests its stimulating factors as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or therapy.\n",
      "In this review, we are going to summarize the RAGE signaling pathway and its contribution to the pathogenesis of human diseases, focused specifically on kidney diseases.\n",
      "Further, we propose the possibility of using RAGE and its ligands as therapeutic targets.\n",
      "Human RAGE is encoded by a gene located on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region on chromosome 6 [11].\n",
      "The mature RAGE has three main parts, consisting of extracellular, transmembrane, and cytosolic regions.\n",
      "The extracellular region is composed of one V-type and two C-type domains, and the V-type domain is responsible for interaction with multiple RAGE ligands.\n",
      "The transmembrane domain anchors RAGE to the cellular membrane, and signals transduce into the cell via the cytosolic domain [1, 12].\n",
      "Besides, RAGE variants, represented by three forms, called N-truncated, dominant-negative, and soluble RAGE, can be generated either by natural alternative splicing or by the action of membrane-associated proteases (Fig.1) [1].\n",
      "The N-truncated form of RAGE lacks a V-domain so that it can not interact with ligands, whereas the cytosolic domain is missing in dominant-negative RAGE, which results in no signal transduction, though it can bind to ligands.\n",
      "Without the transmembrane domain, soluble RAGE is formed and is able to circulate out of the cell and act as decoys by preventing ligands from binding to RAGE [13].\n",
      "Therefore, soluble RAGE can neutralize the effect of RAGE ligands, and many studies have suggested that this function might be applied to inhibition of RAGE signals in human diseases [14].\n",
      "RAGE and its ligands are highly expressed in developmental stages and enhance survival of neurons during development [15].\n",
      "After embryonic development, these genes are down-regulated and kept a low expression levels during normal life, except for certain conditions, such as injury and aging [15].\n",
      "Interestingly, unlike other receptors, expression of RAGE is positively regulated by its ligand stimulation, which means that increasing concentration of ligands leads to up-regulation of RAGE.\n",
      "So, RAGE signals are accelerated more and more by the accumulation of signal stimulants [16].\n",
      "RAGE is found on the cell surface of various immune cells, and most of its ligands are mainly secreted by immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells; therefore one of the major roles of RAGE is involved in inflammation [7, 14].\n",
      "Stimulation of RAGE by its ligands activates the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and it then translocates into the nucleus and activates its target genes, including several kinds of cytokines responsible for innate or adaptive immunity [17, 18].\n",
      "Also, NF-κB can bind to glyoxalase (Glo1) and suppress its inhibitory activity on AGE production [19].\n",
      "Target genes of NF-κB include anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl proteins; therefore, cell survival is also under the control of NF-κB [16].\n",
      "In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway itself can be activated by RAGE stimulation.\n",
      "Specifically, activated RAGE is able to stimulate ERK, p38, and JNK, and it leads to induction of cell proliferation [20].\n",
      "Another process involved in RAGE signaling is cell migration via transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signal cascades.\n",
      "TGF-β is activated by RAGE ligand stimulation and enhances its downstream signals.\n",
      "They include the Ras homolog family and Rho-associated kinase, and activation of these genes leads to stable actin filament formation and cell migration [21].\n",
      "Due to RAGE signals being concerned with multiple cellular signaling pathways, in particular with immune responses and cell survival, the development of numerous human diseases is associated with it.\n",
      "They include diabetes, inflammatory diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases, and blockade of RAGE is increasingly proposed as a therapeutic target [4].\n",
      "Expression of RAGE and its ligands is kept at a low level in a wide range of cell types, including endothelium, smooth muscle cells, mononuclear phagocytes, neurons, and cardiac myocytes [22].\n",
      "However, when RAGE ligands are accumulated by pathological development of relevant diseases, it alters the structure of tissues as well as compromise protein function in them [23, 24].\n",
      "Also, increased circulating RAGE ligands induce the expression of their receptor, RAGE; therefore, RAGE ligand signals are stimulated as the ligands increase [16].\n",
      "In kidneys, accumulation of RAGE ligands is well studied to contribute to both diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy (DN).\n",
      "Firstly, AGEs have been found primarily to be up-regulated in renal basement membranes in diabetic nephropathies and in some other renal diseases, including glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, which are not related to diabetes [25].\n",
      "In diabetes, AGEs are highly accumulated by increasing mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species, followed by high intracellular glucose levels [26].\n",
      "Abnormally high concentrations of AGEs impair proximal tubular cells, which are responsible for regulation of AGE metabolism, resulting in damage to those cells and their function [27, 28].\n",
      "Also, kidneys play key roles in the clearance of AGEs, such that the impaired structure of the kidneys by AGEs fails to degrade them [29].\n",
      "In turn, more and more AGEs are accumulated as the kidney is damaged by the action of AGEs, and finally, it results in DN [27, 28, 30].\n",
      "Recently, increasing evidence has shown that RAGE ligands other than AGEs, including HMGB1 and S-100 proteins, are also up-regulated in renal diseases.\n",
      "HMGB1 is a nuclear protein essential for regulating the physical interaction of DNA with certain transcription factors, such as p53 [29]; however, when it is released extracellularly, it is able to mediate inflammatory reactions and contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases, including glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [31, 32].\n",
      "In addition, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as inflammation are also activated in RCC via ERK1/2 activation [32].\n",
      "Interaction between RAGE and its ligands changes renal cellular processes, including inflammation, proliferation, and migration, and they are highly significant processes to keep the normal function of kidneys; therefore, dysregulation of RAGE or its ligand concentrations might give fatal effects, leading to the development and pathogenesis of renal diseases.\n",
      "Title: Diabetic nephropathy\n",
      "\n",
      "DN is one of the diseases triggered by diabetes and finally leads to renal failure and elevation of arterial blood pressure [33].\n",
      "Cellular mechanisms involved in the development and pathogenesis of DN include glomerular hypertrophy, production of oxidative stresses, fibrosis, and inflammation, followed by hyperglycemia.\n",
      "As mediators, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, protein kinases, and NADPH are existing, and hyper-activation of them results in up-regulation of fibrotic and inflammatory factors, including TGF-β [33-36].\n",
      "Also, hyperglycemia stimulates glycation and oxidation of macromolecules, which result in the formation of AGEs as endproducts [37].\n",
      "Accumulated AGEs join in the up-regulation of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress and accelerate the pathogenesis of the disease [38].\n",

      "Cardio-renal syndrome is a combined disorder having both heart and kidney dysfunction.\n",
      "The primary failed organ can be either the heart or kidney, and in both cases, the one that is diseased earlier impairs the other one, and finally, they negatively affect each other [37].\n",
      "One of the suggested mechanisms making these two organs negatively interact with each other is mediated by AGEs [39].\n",
      "Accumulation of AGEs is commonly observed in patients with both heart failure and renal disorders [40, 41].\n",
      "With heart failure, increase of AGEs leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and delayed calcium uptake, which subsequently result in diastolic dysfunction.\n",
      "In addition, accumulation of AGEs in renal dysfunction is negatively affected by highly activated inflammation and fibrosis, and further damage of kidney structure impairs its own function of AGE clearance [39].\n",
      "Symptoms of the disease might be enhanced by this vicious cycle, as well as with other multifactorial signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis.\n",
      "Title: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\n",
      "\n",
      "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is one of the most highly prevalent inherited disorders and is characterized by the development of thousands of epithelial-lined, fluid-filled cysts in the kidney [42].\n",
      "Cell proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis are the major processes of the development and pathogenesis of the disease, and various factors, including chemokines and growth factors, are engaged in these signaling pathways [43-45].\n",
      "Recently, several studies have reported that expression of HMGB1 and certain types of S-100 (S-100A8, 9) is increased around the cystic region and proposed them to be disease-stimulating agents [46-48].\n",
      "So, inflammatory and growth factors secreted by cyst-lined epithelial cells and increased circulating AGEs finally result in compromised renal function at the end stage of the disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "RAGE and its ligands are reported to be abnormally expressed in various cancers, including breast, lung, kidney, thyroid, prostate, and oral cancers.\n",
      "S100 protein, one of the representative ligands of RAGE, which has at least over 20 subtypes, has been well reviewed to play major roles in tumor-related processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and invasion [10].\n",
      "In renal cancer, S100A1 has been observed to be highly expressed in papillary RCC and oncocytoma, which are relatively common types of renal cancers, whereas it is absent in chromophobe RCC [49].\n",
      "Likewise, a broad range of S100 proteins has been detected differently, depending on the subtype of renal carcinoma, which means that it should be a useful biomarker for discriminating the subtype of renal cancers if it is correctly examined [50].\n",
      "In addition, HMGB1, another ligand of RAGE, has appeared to be up-regulated and interacts with its receptor for promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via the ERK pathway in RCC [32].\n",
      "From this evidence, RAGE and its multiple ligands are increasingly suggested as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for different types of renal carcinomas.\n",
      "In various types of renal diseases, including both diabetic- and non-diabetic disorders, RAGE and its ligands are commonly observed to be dysregulated.\n",
      "The major problem of these phenomena in renal diseases might be the vicious cycle that impairs kidney by increased AGEs or when other RAGE ligands fail to remove them, causing these ligands to accumulate and the relevant signals to accelerate.\n",
      "Therefore, numerous studies suggest RAGE and its ligands as new potential targets for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of renal diseases that have abnormal regulation of them.\n",
      "Firstly, ligands expression or secretion level can be used as a diagnostic or staging marker.\n",
      "S100B is already used in evaluations after treatment of melanoma in a clinical setting [51].\n",
      "Secondly, more trials targeting RAGE ligands either with inhibitors of them or the soluble form of RAGE have been reported.\n",
      "Soluble RAGE treatment significantly alleviates the symptoms of nephritis in vivo [52], and in cancer studies, nude mice injected with soluble RAGE-over-expressing cells have shown remarkable inhibition of tumor formation [53].\n",
      "With inhibitors of AGEs, several agents, including aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, have been tried in humans; some of them have shown enhanced renal function in diabetic patients, but these trials were terminated early because of safety concerns [54, 55].\n",
      "Finally, more recently, epigenetic regulation by microRNAs of molecules involved in RAGE signaling pathways is also being studied [56].\n",
      "Structures of receptor for advanced glycation end products and its three main isoforms.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many other human species appeared in evolution in the last 6 million years that have not been able to survive to modern times and are broadly known as archaic humans, as opposed to the extant modern humans.\n",
      "It has always been considered fascinating to compare the modern human genome with that of archaic humans to identify modern human-specific sequence variants and figure out those that made modern humans different from their predecessors or cousin species.\n",
      "Neanderthals are the latest humans to become extinct, and many factors made them the best representatives of archaic humans.\n",
      "Even though a number of comparisons have been made sporadically between Neanderthals and modern humans, mostly following a candidate gene approach, the major breakthrough took place with the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome.\n",
      "The initial genome-wide comparison, based on the first draft of the Neanderthal genome, has generated some interesting inferences regarding variations in functional elements that are not shared by the two species and the debated admixture question.\n",
      "However, there are certain other genetic elements that were not included or included at a smaller scale in those studies, and they should be compared comprehensively to better understand the molecular make-up of modern humans and their phenotypic characteristics.\n",
      "Besides briefly discussing the important outcomes of the comparative analyses made so far between modern humans and Neanderthals, we propose that future comparative studies may include retrotransposons, pseudogenes, and conserved non-coding regions, all of which might have played significant roles during the evolution of modern humans.\n",
      "Modern humans are indeed a very young species compared to their cousins, evolving just about 200,000 years ago (ya), which is a fraction of the 6 million years since the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages [1].\n",
      "Fossils suggest that modern humans first emerged in East Africa and spread fairly quickly all over the world in the next 185,000 years or so (reviewed in Lu et al.[2]).\n",
      "After the divergence of humans and chimps, the major landmark in human history is the emergence of bipedals about 4 million years ago (mya), which enabled them to use their two feet as hands.\n",
      "Many species evolved afterwards until the evolution of Homo erectus, who, for the first time, migrated out of Southern Africa and initiated the spread of humans all around the globe.\n",
      "The migrated population of Homo erectus in East Africa eventually gave rise to modern humans about 200,000 ya and to Homo neanderthalensis, or Neanderthals, about 400,000 ya [3, 4].\n",
      "Neanderthals survived until 28,000 ya, while modern humans are still surviving [5].\n",
      "During the latter part of their existence, Neanderthals lived in Europe, as well as in Western Asia and the Middle East [6, 7].\n",
      "Various lines of evidence suggest that modern humans started to migrate from East Africa to Europe and other parts of the world 100,000 ya, and the fossil evidence of humans and Neanderthals indicated that these species might have come into contact as early as 80,000 ya and co-habited for up to 10,000 years at certain geographic locations [6].\n",
      "In the field of evolutionary biology, one of the most sought after questions has been what made modern humans superior than other related species-i.e., the genomic features that are unique to humans.\n",
      "The whole-genome sequencing of chimps, rhesus macaque, and other primates has given considerable boosts in this field, as the sequences of these primates opened up the possibility to conduct comprehensive comparative studies to the single-nucleotide level [8, 9].\n",
      "Many attempts have been taken to identify the genetic reasons why modern humans developed such complex biological features than other primates, including the larger brain-to-body ratio, bipedalism, morphological changes, and significant development of communication skills and cognitive behavior.\n",
      "Recent studies have used various statistical methods to compare the sequence of these primates with humans in an attempt to find human-specific genes and gene regulatory sequences, eventually showing unexpectedly rapid evolution in the human lineage after the divergence from the ancestral primates [10-15].\n",
      "The results from these analyses exhibit a good overview of the human-specific genomic elements, but these results are unable to distinguish which of these human-specific elements are specific to modern humans only.\n",
      "Since there has been no complete genome sequence of any archaic humans until recently, such sequence comparisons have been made only between the modern human genome and other primates, bypassing archaic humans, resulting in an overwhelming number of differences and the inability to identify which sequences changes are unique to modern humans and which are shared by all Homo species.\n",
      "Therefore, the comparative analysis between modern humans and archaic humans is expected to be more interesting and valuable by being more effective in identifying the critical genes and/or regulatory elements that may be fully or partially responsible for the evolution of the modern humans over other humans.\n",
      "In order to identify such sequence changes, the modern human genome sequence must be compared with that of archaic humans.\n",
      "Neanderthals have always been a desired target for this purpose for multiple reasons.\n",
      "They are the closest cousins of modern humans, both anatomically and based on intelligence.\n",
      "Their slightly larger brain and wider body structure are the primary anatomical differences from the modern humans [16].\n",
      "Fossil evidence suggests that Neanderthals used stone tools, they were hunter gatherers, and they had a social life, indicating that they had similar intelligence as modern humans until about 50,000 ya, when a \"Creative explosion\" occurred in modern humans [17, 18].\n",
      "Another critical reason to target Neanderthals is that they are the latest archaic humans to go extinct, and their remains have been found in sufficiently good condition for analyzing down to the molecular level [19-21].\n",
      "To make a comprehensive genomic comparison between modern and archaic humans, the whole genome of archaic humans has to be sequenced.\n",
      "The availability and widespread use of massively parallel high-throughput sequencing have now made it possible to sequence archaic genomes, which seemed impossible even a decade ago.\n",
      "The idea of sequencing an ancient genome was first implemented on cave bear [22] and, after its success, the mammoth genome [23].\n",
      "The initial sequencing attempts on Neanderthals included sequencing of the mitochondrial genome, which was successful to a certain extent [24-26].\n",
      "These successes eventually led paleogeneticists to attempt sequencing Neanderthal nuclear genomes.\n",
      "Almost all of the attempts have been made by amplifying the genome fragments via PCR and parallel sequencing, while some involve the use of a metagenomic approach.\n",
      "The early success of such attempts eventually led to the establishment of the Neanderthal Genome Project in 2005, which first announced the complete genome sequence of Neanderthals in 2010 [27] and recently released a cleaner and higher-coverage version (http://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/).\n",
      "Comprehensive comparisons have been made by the group on certain genetic entities with some very interesting inferences, based on the initial low-coverage sequencing data, but improvements in many aspects can be made by utilizing the recent, better version of the sequence and considering more types of genetic variances in the study.\n",
      "Here, we will discuss the inferences made from the comparison and what can be done next to answer some interesting questions regarding the evolution of modern humans.\n",
      "Many lines of archaeological evidence indicate that humans and Neanderthals may have coexisted in certain geographic locations.\n",
      "This gives rise to the most debatable question regarding the recent history of humans: did modern humans and Neanderthals interbreed?\n",
      "If they did, was it to an extent where meaningful exchange of genetic information may have occurred?\n",
      "Do we still carry any genetic elements of Neanderthals?\n",
      "Comparing the genome sequences is probably the best way to answer all these questions.\n",
      "All other features, including the level of intelligence in Neanderthals, have been speculated from bones, settlements, or artifacts found, and there is no way to be certain about the practicality or validity of the inferences made from these remains.\n",
      "The hypothesis that Neanderthals were able to practice complex behavior has already been disputed [28-30].\n",
      "There has also been a significant amount of debate about the admixture of humans and Neanderthals.\n",
      "Morphological analyses have provided strong arguments both for and against the genetic exchange between these two species [31, 32], as have the comparative analyses of DNA sequences of these species [33-35].\n",
      "The genome sequence itself can not validate many of these inferences, either, but it can answer the question of admixture and articulate the genetic elements that are unique to Neanderthals or to humans or those that are shared by both.\n",
      "Studies on the expression or protein functions in association with these unique elements, despite being plausible only for those found in the human genome, can eventually facilitate analysis of complex biological phenomena, such as reasoning, language, or other qualitative or behavioral traits, at the molecular level.\n",
      "In the past, a candidate gene approach has been successfully implemented to identify the presence or variance of certain genes that were believed to be modern human-specific.\n",
      "Using this approach, a number of speculations about Neanderthals could be made, including their skin and hair color.\n",
      "It was also discovered that Neanderthals had the same FOXP2 gene as modern humans, which was previously linked to language ability [36].\n",
      "This approach of fishing for particular genes proved efficient, but there is a lot more than known genes in the whole genome that may play a critical regulatory role in gene expression and thus development.\n",
      "For instance, almost half of the human genome consists of transposable elements; these elements can affect gene expression by activating or deactivation functional genetic elements and by altering the protein coding by creating alternative splicing or creating new chimeric genes ([37-39], reviewed in [40, 41]).\n",
      "Transposable elements are also polymorphic among different populations of modern humans, and their association with phenotypic traits, including diseases, has been extensively studied, albeit with a lot more to be learned [42-44].\n",
      "The whole-genome sequence is necessary for identifying transposable element insertions that may have taken place only in modern humans and subsequently assessing their functional impact.\n",
      "Title: Comparative analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The only part of the Neanderthal genome that was sequenced completely from multiple specimens until recently was the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).\n",
      "The major analysis that was made with the mtDNA sequence was to seek an answer to the question of interbreeding.\n",
      "The Neanderthal mtDNA sequence consistently falls outside the spectrum of variations observed in the modern human mtDNA sequence, indicating no interbreeding between the species [24-26, 45, 46].\n",
      "Previously, besides detecting specific mutations in MCPH1 and FOXP2, the candidate gene approach also detected the presence of fragments of the MC1R gene that may indicate the red hair and pale skin of Neanderthals [47], segments of the ABO blood group locus [48], and a taste receptor gene [49].\n",
      "Despite many critical technical challenges in sequencing ancient genomes ([26]; reviewed in [50]), the whole genome of Neanderthals has been sequenced recently by Green et al.\n",
      "[27], and it allowed this research group to perform a genome-wide sequence comparison with the modern human genome sequence, and the significant results from the initial analyses are discussed briefly below.\n",
      "Title: Substitutions and indels\n",
      "\n",
      "Green et al.\n",
      "[27] inferred that 10,535,445 substitutions and 479,863 indels have occurred in the modern human genome after the divergence from chimps.\n",
      "The vast majority of these occurred before Neanderthals and modern humans diverged.\n",
      "However, 78 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that are fixed for a derived state in modern humans are different in the Neanderthal counterpart, as Neanderthals carry the ancestral state of these polymorphic nucleotides.\n",
      "Only five genes were identified that have more than one fixed substitution in their coding regions, and one of them has an altered start or stop codon.\n",
      "It is particularly interesting that three of these genes are expressed in skin, including RPTN, which encodes the protein repetin, and TRPMI, which encodes melastatin.\n",
      "This might be indicative of a change in selection of skin physiology in the modern human lineage.\n",
      "When looking into differences in regulatory elements, a total of 132 substitutions and 36 indels were identified in the untranslated regions.\n",
      "One microRNA of unknown function, hsa-mir-1304, which was identified by parallel sequencing of human embryonic stem cells [51], was found to have one fixed substitution and one single nucleotide insertion.\n",
      "Since the substitution occurs in the seed region, it is not unlikely that this microRNA has different targets between these two species.\n",
      "Title: Selective sweeps in modern humans\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 212 positively selected regions identified in modern humans that occurred early during the history in conjunction with or shortly after their divergence from Neanderthals.\n",
      "The largest of the positively selected regions contains the gene THADA, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of which have been linked with type II diabetes [52].\n",
      "This change may have affected the energy metabolism of early modern humans.\n",
      "A number of other genes that lie on these selectively swept regions have been associated with other genetic disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and Down syndrome.\n",
      "Since both autism and schizophrenia are related to cognitive development, it could be assumed that multiple genes involved in cognitive development in humans were positively selected early in the history of modern humans.\n",
      "Title: Admixture\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though previous studies with Neanderthal mtDNA [26, 33] and initial sequencing of nuclear DNA showed no evidence of interbreeding between Neanderthals and humans [21, 53], the most striking revelation after the comparative analyses between the whole-genome sequence of Neanderthals and multiple modern human individual genomic sequences was the demonstration of admixture between these two species.\n",
      "Green et al.\n",
      "[27] compared the Neanderthal genome with eight modern-day human genomes of European Americans, East Asians, and West African ancestry.\n",
      "Surprisingly, the Neanderthal genome appeared more similar to all non-African genomes than to African ones.\n",
      "They share significantly more derived alleles (alleles that are different from in chimp) with non-African populations than with the African, and when compared with European and Asian individual genomes, Neanderthals are found equally close to both populations.\n",
      "This and some other analyses made by the group only indicate an exchange of DNA between Neanderthals and the non-African population.\n",
      "With further comparative analysis, the same group also identified that gene flow occurred unidirectionally from Neanderthals to the modern non-African human population.\n",
      "A couple of other findings from different experiments, along with a genome-wide comparison, provide strong evidence for exchange of genetic information.\n",
      "The first finding involves the MAPT locus in chromosome 17, which has two distinct haplotypes, H1 and H2.\n",
      "H1 is abundant in almost all populations of modern humans, while H2 is found only among Europeans and found to have entered into the Homo lineage approximately only 10,000 to 30,000 ya.\n",
      "However, a comparison between H1 and H2 in chimp suggests that the common founder of H1 and H2 is far older than 30,000 years.\n",
      "Even though the Neanderthal genome sequence has been found to carry the H1 haplotype, coinhabitation of the H2 chromosome carriers during the time period when modern humans coexisted with archaic humans can not be ruled out because of the scarcity of archaic genome data.\n",
      "Thus, one can still argue that the H2 haplotype found in modern humans could possibly be a result of horizontal gene transfer between modern humans and Neanderthals and remained in modern humans under selective pressure, possibly because the H1 haplotype has a role in neurodegenerative diseases [54].\n",
      "In a similar scenario, haplotype D of the microcephalin gene is found to have originated 1.1 mya in a lineage other than modern humans but integrated into the modern human genome only about 37,000 ya.\n",
      "It has thus been speculated that this haplotype was horizontally transferred into modern humans from archaic humans, most likely Neanderthals [34].\n",
      "However, in a more recent study, the microcephalin locus from a Neanderthal individual in Italy was sequenced and found to be homozygous for the ancestral non-D haplotype [55].\n",
      "The whole-genome study by Green et al.\n",
      "[27] does not support these speculations, either, since the Neanderthals they analyzed do not carry these D-haplotypes.\n",
      "One striking revelation from the whole-genome comparison by Green et al.\n",
      "[27] is the equal level of similarity of the Neanderthal genome with Papuan and Chinese and French, although fossil records show the existence of Neanderthals only in Europe and western Asia.\n",
      "The group explained this anomaly by arguing that the interbreeding between the species occurred earlier than previously expected, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and Papuans.\n",
      "Archaeological evidence suggests that modern humans appeared in the Middle East before 100,000 ya, where Neanderthals were already present, and probably remained until 50,000 ya [56]; this makes the prediction by Green et al.\n",
      "[27] probable.\n",
      "Title: Increasing coverage, sequencing more Neanderthals, and the Y chromosome\n",
      "\n",
      "For a more comprehensive comparison of whole-genome sequences between Neanderthals and modern humans, the sequence coverage of Neanderthals has to be increased.\n",
      "The three approaches made so far to sequence the Neanderthal genome have resulted in the sequencing of only 65,000 bases [21], 1 million bases [19], and finally, the draft genome sequenced recently [27], consisting of only two-thirds of the whole genome with a mere 1.3× coverage.\n",
      "With such low coverage, it is hard to form meaningful contigs, and a number of important genetic entities will remain unnoticed.\n",
      "Even though it was beyond imagination to sequence a Pleistocene specimen a decade ago, the progress that has been made in the last 5 years is good enough to expect that more such specimens be sequenced in coming years.\n",
      "The more specimens from various geographic locations that are sequenced, the more likely it will be to construct a reference genome sequence for Neanderthals.\n",
      "As the human genome sequence varies considerably among different populations, it is expected that Neanderthals also have variation in their genomic sequences among different populations from different locations.\n",
      "Such variations can only be identified by sequencing a wide range of specimens, and these variations may again change insights into the Neanderthal-modern human relationship.\n",
      "The sequencing of Neanderthals first started with its mitochondrial DNA in 1997 [25].\n",
      "Comparisons between Neanderthal and modern human mitochondrial DNA have been made extensively, but these comparisons only reveal the maternally inherited difference between the species, as mitochondria DNA is transmitted maternally.\n",
      "The complete genomic sequence of Neanderthals published recently is also from a female specimen.\n",
      "Thus, the Y-chromosome of Neanderthals or paternal inheritance has yet to be examined.\n",
      "Comparisons of the Y chromosome sequence of Neanderthals with currently established Y-haplogroups for modern humans should provide some insights into the admixture hypothesis.\n",
      "With respect to the recent finding of admixture of Neanderthals with non-African populations, the Neanderthal Y chromosome should not match the Y haplogroups A or B, as these haplogroups are the oldest of the clades and almost restricted to Africans and their descendants [57, 58].\n",
      "Since haplogroup E is found in Africa, the Middle East, Southern Europe, and Asia [59-61], the Neanderthal Y chromosome may match this haplogroup, but it should not match the haplogroups E1b1a*, E2b1, or B2a1a, as they are specifically treated as Bantu expansion markers, while Neanderthals interbred only with non-Africans [62, 63].\n",
      "Title: Retrotransposon insertion polymorphism\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost half of the human genome comprises retrotransposons.\n",
      "Although they were overlooked for a significant period of time in our genetic study, their importance in chromosome structure, gene regulation, and disease predisposition has now been well established.\n",
      "Retroelements are widely divided into two categories-one with long terminal repeats (LTRs) and another without the LTRs.\n",
      "Short and long interspersed repeat elements (SINEs and LINEs, respectively) are two of the major classes of non-LTR retroelements, while SINEs are the more abundant class.\n",
      "Among SINEs, Alu is the predominant type of retroelement.\n",
      "Among all Alus found in the entire human genome, only about 0.5% is found to be present in the human genome but absent in orthologous regions of other primates and are thus identified as human-specific.\n",
      "This 'young' group of Alus is composed of only about 5,000 Alu elements that are believed to have integrated in the human genome after the divergence of humans and great apes [64-68].\n",
      "Studying the retrotransposon insertion loci in Neanderthals will identify truly modern human-specific retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms.\n",
      "A similar comparative analysis would reveal other transposable elements, such as L1, SVAs, and HERVs, that are specific to modern humans only, as well as those that are specific to Neanderthals.\n",
      "Retroelements are particularly important in population genetics.\n",
      "It is extremely rare that a newly inserted transposable element is completely excised; thus, they act as a genetic fossil that is homoplasy-free.\n",
      "This identical-by-descent nature of retroelements makes them better markers for population and evolutionary studies than SNPs, in the sense that SNPs can, though rarely, be mutated back to the previous state.\n",
      "SNPs are also very hard to detect while handling ancient genomes due to transformation and deamination [69], while retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs) refer to the presence or absence of a retrotransposon.\n",
      "Once a retrotransposon is inserted at a new location in an individual, it is subject to genetic drift.\n",
      "Over a short period, it starts spreading in to the population.\n",
      "Depending on when a retroelement has integrated at a certain locus, it will be shared by different species or, if recently enough, by different populations of the same species.\n",
      "Thus, RIPs occurring before the divergence of chimps and humans are shared by humans and chimps, but those occurring after are present only in humans.\n",
      "RIPs that are even more recent are specific to certain human populations only [70, 71].\n",
      "For instance, some RIPs are found only in Africans, some in Han Chinese, and so on.\n",
      "The detailed information about all polymorphic retroelements and their frequency in different populations is extensively cataloged in the dbRIP database [43].\n",
      "The identical-by-descent and homoplasy-free nature of RIPs makes them useful genetic markers in population and evolutionary genetics.\n",
      "The specificity of RIPs can play a significant role in answering the question of admixture of Neanderthals and modern humans.\n",
      "Finding RIPs that are shared between Neanderthals and non-African populations but not present in African populations can be considered solid support for the proposed admixture between Neanderthals and non-African populations.\n",
      "In an ongoing study in our laboratory, over 500 RIPs were identified to be present in Khoisan and Bantu individuals, who represent the oldest lineage of modern humans from Southern Africa, but not in the reference human genome (unpublished).\n",
      "These oldest African lineage-specific RIPs theoretically should also be absent from Neanderthals.\n",
      "Title: Human-specific unprocessed pseudogenes\n",
      "\n",
      "Pseudogenization has always been an interesting topic that has not been explored much.\n",
      "Many pseudogenes have been identified lately that lost their functional capacity in human lineage after the divergence of humans and chimps, particularly related to immunological functions [72].\n",
      "The \"less is more\" hypothesis states that gene loss may direct evolutionary changes, as these pseudogenized genes have impacts on adaptation of the species through evolution [73].\n",
      "Even though pseudogenization does not initiate under selective pressure, the gene loss is retained and subsequently allows adaptation.\n",
      "Pseudogenes are found particularly important in humans, and some of them have even been identified as being responsible for certain human-specific phenotypes.\n",
      "For example, the sarcomeric myosin gene was lost at the time of emergence of the genus Homo and is thought to be responsible for marked reduction of hominin masticatory muscles, leading to expansion of brain size [74].\n",
      "Analyzing pseudogenes in Neanderthals would be beneficial to identify genes that were lost after the divergence of Neanderthals and modern humans and determine what biological impact they may have.\n",
      "Title: Human accelerated conserved noncoding sequences (HACNSs)\n",
      "\n",
      "HACNSs are sequences in the human genome that were conserved throughout vertebrate history but changed significantly after the divergence of humans and chimps.\n",
      "Human genomes have a number of such sequences that obtained surprisingly more mutations after the emergence of humans than before.\n",
      "These regions are typically rich in cis-regulatory transcriptional enhancers that render specific expression pattern of genes involved during development [75-77].\n",
      "Identification of these cis-regulatory elements in human or other large genomes is done mostly by cross-species sequence comparison, primarily because the functional cis-regulatory elements are generally unique to the genome, which makes paralogy-based identification of such sequences nearly impossible [78].\n",
      "Since it has long been proposed that phenotypic variation between humans and chimps is mostly brought about by regulatory elements than coding sequences [79], it would be particularly interesting to make an elaborated comparison between differences in conserved regions in modern humans and Neanderthals.\n",
      "Such a comparison between the human genome and initial Neanderthal draft genome sequence [27], involving a total of 2,613 human accelerated regions, revealed that the Neanderthal sequence carried 3,259 human-specific changes in these regions.\n",
      "The comparison revealed that 51 positions in 45 regions were different between these two species; Neanderthals carried the ancestral form while all modern humans carry the human-specific variant.\n",
      "In a recent study, it has been found that the Neanderthal genome retains the ancestral state of a polymorphic site in a conserved noncoding microRNA, which is involved in regulating two genes that are important for teeth formation [80].\n",
      "This may explain the dental differences between modern humans and Neanderthals.\n",
      "These findings are interesting enough to initiate further studies to analyze the probable impact of the variations in conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) that exist between these two species.\n",
      "Furthermore, previously in three different studies, the number of HACNSs was found to be between 202 and 1175 [10, 11, 15].\n",
      "All these studies used different methods to identify CNSs and included more species during the comparison.\n",
      "Their data can also be included in the future for the comparison of CNSs between modern humans and Neanderthals.\n",
      "The most rapidly evolving HACNS identified so far, named HACNS1, has accumulated 16 human-specific changes out of its 546 bases since the divergence of humans and chimps [12].\n",
      "HACNS1 functions in multiple structures early in the developing stages of the mouse embryo as a transcriptional enhancer, including the developing anterior limb [12].\n",
      "But, this function is missing for the orthologous enhancers in chimpanzee and rhesus, suggesting that HACNS1 has a different function in humans.\n",
      "When the chimpanzee enhancers are humanized by introducing 13 of the 16 human-specific substitutions, gene expression was observed in the limb, indicating that the substitutions that were identified by comparative analysis were directly responsible for the functional modification.\n",
      "In a recent study, 16 human-specific mutations in HACNS1 were also found in Neanderthals, suggesting that the phenotypic function that is related to this region was also expressed in Neanderthals [81].\n",
      "The comparison can be extended to other human accelerated CNS regions to identify any substitutions that occurred after the divergence of humans from Neanderthals.\n",
      "Conserved regions have also been presumed to play important roles in developing certain functions in humans-for instance, noncoding regions of 150 presynaptic genes in humans are highly conserved and may have critical regulatory roles in the expression of these genes [82].\n",
      "Comparative analyses of these regions between different populations of modern humans and Neanderthals may give directions to a better understanding of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "Involvement of noncoding sequences in the developing brain was also revealed by another experiment involving 49 human accelerated regions (HARs); the most accelerated region in the human genome, HAR1, is part of a noncoding RNA sequence expressed in the developing brain [83].\n",
      "A study by Burbano et al.\n",
      "[83] identified that 8.3% of HAR substitutions are not shared between modern humans and Neanderthals, but the study did not focus on HAR1.\n",
      "A complete Neanderthal genomic sequence should provide an understanding of the evolutionary origin of these regulatory RNAs.\n",
      "Despite many technical challenges, the whole-genome sequence for a Homo species other than modern human is now there for the first time in just five years of the establishment of the project.\n",
      "It is no longer a question of the possibility of sequencing more genomes from archaic remains, and more such achievements will only strengthen our understanding of human evolution.\n",
      "All of our knowledge on human species-specific genetic elements thus far is based on comparison with non-human primates, which gives us information only on how humans are different from other primates, such as chimpanzee-not how modern humans excelled from archaic humans.\n",
      "Modern humans are considerably superior to their predecessors, and the availability of high-quality Neanderthal sequences can shed some light on the genetic basis of this phenomenon.\n",
      "An initial comparison between the genome sequences of these two species has given us some valuable insight, and more studies are being conducted to identify further variations between Neanderthal and humans.\n",
      "However, a lot remains to be done, which has been discussed in this article, albeit briefly.\n",
      "Even though the sequence comparison itself can not provide much confidence on the biological differences between the Homo species, the application of reverse genetics can be initiated from this point to speculate and validate the possible biological effects of such sequence differences.\n",
      "Once the molecular functions of such differences are identified in an in vitro analysis, they can be administered into mouse models to observe the phenotypic results of these changes.\n",
      "One such experiment has already been implemented by administering a human version of FOXP2 in the mouse genome to observe its effects [84].\n",
      "Many behavioral and qualitative traits of humans can be understood at the molecular level using similar approaches.\n",
      "There has also been hype by the media over resurrecting Neanderthals by modifying the chimpanzee genome to be more Neanderthal-like [85].\n",
      "But, it is still an impossible task to regenerate a species just from the genomic sequence, even if the ethical issues can be resolved [86].\n",
      "However, Neanderthals do not have to be reincarnated to provide us with an enormous opportunity in the field of human genetics and evolution, as their genome is already offering a lot to better our understanding of ourselves.\n",

      "In the present study, we integrated and analyzed the exome sequencing data from ~3,000 tissue samples and summarized the major mutant genes in each of the diverse cancer subtypes and stages.\n",
      "Mutations were observed in most human genes (~23,000 genes) with low frequency from an analysis of 11 major cancer subtypes.\n",
      "The majority of tissue samples harbored 20-80 different mutant genes, on average.\n",
      "Lung cancer samples showed a greater number of mutations in diverse genes than other cancer subtypes.\n",
      "Only a few genes were mutated with over 5% frequency in tissue samples.\n",
      "Interestingly, mutation frequency was generally similar between non-metastatic and metastastic samples in most cancer subtypes.\n",
      "Among the 12 major mutations, the TP53, USH2A, TTN, and MUC16 genes were found to be frequent in most cancer types, while BRAF, FRG1B, PBRM1, and VHL showed lineage-specific mutation patterns.\n",
      "The present study provides a useful resource to understand the broad spectrum of mutation frequencies in various cancer types.\n",
      "Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing technology has contributed to the generation of genome-wide somatic mutation profiles in diverse cancer samples.\n",

      "Particularly, information on genome-wide somatic mutations has been collectively profiled from exome sequencing data from thousands of patients' tumor samples.\n",
      "Somatic mutation is a main driving force for cancer development and progression.\n",
      "Thus, many researchers have tried to complete the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer cell lines [1, 2].\n",
      "Somatic mutation is also known to be involved in key mechanisms for cellular sensitivity or resistance against chemotherapy [3-5].\n",
      "In our previous study using cancer cell line data, we reported that somatic mutation was a more significant classifier than cancer lineage in predicting the anticancer drug response [6].\n",
      "Thus, we identified many unknown association patterns between cancer drug response and mutational genotypes in cancer cell lines-e.g., MYC-amp mutation-specific sensitivity of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor inhibitors.\n",
      "In addition, mutation information provided important clues for us to better interpret the biological relevance of molecular signatures identified from the transcriptome and proteome data of diverse cancer cell lines.\n",
      "The next step should be to find out the clinical application of mutation-specific drug responses or molecular signatures obtained from cell line-based analysis.\n",
      "Thus, it is important to systematically analyze the mutational genotype (mutaome) of various human tissue samples and identify mutations significantly associated with specific types of tumors.\n",

      "Therefore, several studies suggested KLF5 is downstream of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ and upstream of PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation [4, 5].\n",

      "Although many studies have shown the influence of ethnicity on BMR, their results have been inconsistent [11, 12].\n",

      "Up to the present, alleles of specific genes, such as UCP1, LPL, and beta3-AR, were considered to play a major role in the development of metabolic complications in the obese population [22].\n",
      "Moreover, some reports suggested that the variation in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene influences BMR in obese subjects and that the synergistic effect of polymorphisms in UCP1 and beta3-adrenergic receptor genes leads to a lower BMR [15, 23].\n",

      "KLF5 has also been involved in vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation, growth, and gene expression [3].\n",
      "In this population, we divided them into two groups by BMI: normal weight and overweight.\n",
      "Children who are overweight have the potential to be obese adults when they grow up.\n",
      "We could infer from the relationship between the KLF5 polymorphism and BMR that the variation of KLF is associated with obesity.\n",
      "Several studies of diverse ethnic groups, including Pima Indians, Caucasians, and Japanese, have demonstrated that obese individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher BMR compared to the obese non-diabetic populations [26].\n",
      "In our result, 58% of children in the high-BMR group were overweight, and the children with the TT mutant homozygote of KLF5 came under the high-BMR group.\n",
      "Recently, the predicting equations for BMR have been verified in many populations [12, 27-29].\n",
      "To cross-validate three predicting equations for BMR established by the Schofield database, Henry, and Cole, Ramirez-Zea M used mean values for age, weight, height, and BMR.\n",
      "These findings suggested that the equation seemed to be appropriate to estimate BMR in men only, not women [28].\n",
      "Another study indicated that a new equation may be more appropriate for calculating BMR using age, height, weight, and fat in obese children [27].\n",
      "In our equation, we determined a BMR equation for children between the ages of 10 and 13 years old based on age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, and fat mass.\n",
      "Our predicting equation in children was similar to the previous studies.\n",
      "In the normal-weight group, we observed that the variables of age, weight, muscle, RI, glucose, and insulin were significant predictors of BMR, which accounted for 100% of the variation in BMR.\n",
      "However, the final model of our equation for BMR in the overweight group included both weight and muscle (data not shown).\n",
      "On the other hand, we divided them into 2 groups: low- and high-BMR group.\n",
      "In the high-BMR group, we established the predictive equation using muscle, fat mass, RI, and C-peptide.\n",
      "We observed an inverse correlation between BMR and RI in the high-BMR group, and the children with the TT genotype belonged to the high-BMR group.\n",
      "These results indicated that the children with the TT genotype have a higher BMR compared with the children with the CC genotype.\n",
      "Although the mean insulin value was higher in the children with the TT genotype than those with the CC genotype, there was no significant association between HOMA-IR and TT genotype in our subjects.\n",
      "We postulated that the relation of insulin and HOMA-IR may contribute to insulin resistance (IR) in our children.\n",
      "IR was calculated according to HOMA using fasting insulin and glucose concentrations [30].\n",
      "Children who were overweight have a higher morbidity rate of obesity than children with normal weight.\n",
      "Obese adults have more IR than normal, which may predispose them to diabetes [30].\n",
      "Obesity-induced IR is the major contributor of metabolic syndrome, and both obesity and IR are components of metabolic syndrome [31, 32].\n",
      "However, we could not observe IR.\n",
      "Also, the insulin value and HOMA-IR were not involved in the equation of the overweight group.\n",
      "In the high-BMR group only, we observed that the higher C-peptide affected the increase of BMR in children with the TT genotype.\n",
      "Therefore, obese children with the TT genotype may have no potential for becoming obese adults with metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "There are several limitations in this study.\n",
      "First of all, a sample size of this study was too small, because 1) it was necessary to use a direct calorimeter for measuring RMR, but the device and its expendables, such as mouthpieces, were too expensive and not cost-effective for our study.\n",
      "If the children were unable to reach steady-state oxygen consumption in the allotted time of approximately 10 min, the children repeated numerous times after resting, and it was not easy for younger participants.\n",
      "2) Parent's signed permission for these children was mandatory at the first visit, but several parents and children rejected informed consent.\n",
      "3) It was not sufficient to obtain the blood samples of all children for analyzing the genetic polymorphism of KLF5, and there was a genotyping error sometimes.\n",
      "Second, we could not find out the citations to explain the association between the KLF5 polymorphism and BMR.\n",
      "There is abundant satisfactory research showing the predictive equation for BMR in several populations.\n",
      "Although we discovered the studies to suggest the genes involved in the regulation of energy expenditure metabolism, including UCP1, there was not enough research to demonstrate the association of KLF5 and BMR in this study.\n",
      "In this study, we found that the TT homozygote of KLF5 plays a crucial role for increasing BMR and fat mass in Korean children.\n",

      "The five Flavobacterium species isolated from freshwater and 37 other strains were classified based on six housekeeping genes: gyrB, dnaK, tuf, murG, atpA, and glyA.\n",
      "The genes were amplified by PCR and subjected to DNA sequencing.\n",
      "Based on the combined DNA sequence (4,412 bp) of the six housekeeping genes, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among the Flavobacterium species.\n",
      "The results indicated that MLSA, based on the six housekeeping genes, is a trustworthy method for the identification of closely related Flavobacterium species.\n",

      "Since then, a number of Flavobacterium species have been identified, and the classification of the genus has been continuously amended.\n",
      "At present, it is widely accepted that the genus Flavobacterium contains bacteria that are yellow-pigmented, aerobic, and generally rod-shaped [2], and some Flavobacterium species mobilize through a gliding motility mechanism [3].\n",
      "Flavobacterium strains could be isolated from various habitats, including freshwater, soil, plants, and food [3, 4].\n",
      "The 16S rRNA gene has been widely used in many studies concerned with the identification or classification of microorganisms.\n",
      "However, using only one housekeeping gene as a single marker is not enough to distinguish some bacterial species, especially when they are closely related.\n",
      "In addition, gene-specific changes caused by horizontal gene transfer or recombination could be an obstacle to the phylogenetic studies that are based on a single gene marker [5, 6].\n",
      "To overcome the limitation, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) has been proposed as an alternative method in many studies.\n",
      "In reality, MLSA is a microbial genotyping method used to characterize a variety of microorganisms, including the genera of Pantoea [7], Bifidobacterium [8], Borrelia [9], Bradyrhizobium [10], and Bacteroides [11].\n",

      "In this study, to determine the phylogenetic relationship of the five closely related Flavobacterium species that were previously isolated from a freshwater reservoir in Chonan, Korea [13, 14], we constructed a maximum-liklihood phylogenetic tree, but the tree showed a very low bootstrap value (<25%) between them.\n",
      "Previously, Nicolas et al.\n",
      "[15] recommended several housekeeping genes to analyze the phylogenetic relationship among fish-pathogenic F. psychrophilum strains.\n",
      "This approach is called MLSA, which is very useful for distinguishing closely related species and showing population structure.\n",
      "We have chosen seven housekeeping genes as phylogenetic markers-atpA, dnaK, glyA, gyrB, murG, tuf (elongation factor Tu), and trpB (tryptophan synthase, subunit B)-because these loci contain the largest amounts of polymorphisms among the 50 F. psychrophilum strains [15].\n",
      "This study is the first to apply Flavobacterium species isolated from a freshwater reservoir.\n",
      "First, we tried to amplify seven housekeeping genes from five Flavobacterium isolates [13, 14], which are closely related to each other based on the 16S rRNA gene.\n",
      "However, we could not amplify the trpB gene from our samples from a freshwater reservoir.\n",
      "Therefore, we collected the sequences of six housekeeping genes and the 16S rRNA gene from five Flavobacterium isolates [13, 14], isolated from a freshwater reservoir in Cheonan, Korea, and two Flavobacterium reference strains, F. aquatile ATCC 11947 and F. frigidimaris F3-JCM122, as interspecies out-groups.\n",
      "In addition, we searched for more Flavobacterium species that were available for the six housekeeping genes from the GenBank database.\n",
      "We found that 52 Flavobacterium species were available for all six housekeeping gene sequences in the database.\n",
      "Among them, 50 Flavobacterium species were F. psychrophilum that were identified and studied by Nicolas et al.[15].\n",
      "The 50 F. psychrophila were assigned to 33 sequence types.\n",
      "Consequently, to evaluate the resolution and efficiency of MLSA, we aligned and trimmed each housekeeping gene sequence (555 bp of gyrB, 680 bp of dnaK, 833 bp of tuf, 725 bp of murG, 796 bp of atpA, and 823 bp of glyA genes) from the five Flavobacterium isolates, 33 distinct F. psychrophila, two other Flavobacterium species (F. branchiophilum FL-15 and F. indicum GPTSA100-9), and two reference strains.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.1, we constructed two different phylogenetic trees of the Flavobacterium species, based on only 16S rRNA gene sequences (Fig.1A) and based on the concatenated sequences of the six housekeeping genes (Fig.1B).\n",
      "The bootstrap values of the tree branches clearly improved in Fig.1B compared with those in Fig.1A.\n",
      "Therefore, we could state that the phylogenetic tree of the genus Flavobacterium, produced by the MLSA approach, is more reliable than the tree based on a single locus (e.g., 16S rRNA gene).\n",
      "To investigate the nucleotide diversity of each gene among the 10 Flavobacterium species, we analyzed the pairwise distances determined by MEGA5.05 (Table 2).\n",
      "Among the six housekeeping genes and the 16S rRNA gene, the highest average pairwise distance was 0.303 in murG, while the lowest average pairwise distance was 0.043 in the 16S rRNA gene.\n",
      "We found that the average pairwise distance within the gyrB, dnaK, tuf, atpA, and glyA genes was 0.218, 0.141, 0.115, 0.150, and 0.215, respectively, among Flavobacterium species.\n",
      "In addition, we estimated the pairwise distance of the six concatenated housekeeping genes, and thus, the pairwise distance was 0.164 on average.\n",
      "The pairwise distance of the six concatenated housekeeping genes was significantly greater than the pairwise distance of the 16S rRNA gene (0.043).\n",
      "Next, we analyzed G + C contents and variable nucleotide sites of six housekeeping genes in our MLSA data and 16S rRNA gene (Table 2).\n",
      "The G + C contents of the genes ranged from 35.4% (murG) to 48.9% (16S rRNA) (Table 2).\n",
      "The G + C content among housekeeping genes was found to be variable.\n",
      "As a result, this study has demonstrated that MLSA, based on multiloci, produces more reliable phylogenetic trees among Flavobacterium species compared with the tree based on a single locus (e.g., 16S rRNA).\n",
      "When a high number of sequential similarities exist in genetic markers, it might be difficult to identify the phylogenetic relationship between microorganisms of the same genus.\n",

      "RNA analysis has become a reliable method of body fluid identification for forensic use.\n",
      "Previously, we developed a combination of four multiplex quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) probes to discriminate four different body fluids (blood, semen, saliva, and vaginal secretion).\n",
      "While those makers successfully identified most body fluid samples, there were some cases of false positive and negative identification.\n",
      "To improve the accuracy of the identification further, we tried to use multiple markers per body fluid and adopted the NanoString nCounter system instead of a multiplex qRT-PCR system.\n",
      "After measuring tens of RNA markers, we evaluated the accuracy of each marker for body fluid identification.\n",
      "For body fluids, such as blood and semen, each body fluid-specific marker was accurate enough for perfect identification.\n",
      "However, for saliva and vaginal secretion, no single marker was perfect.\n",
      "Thus, we designed a logistic regression model with multiple markers for saliva and vaginal secretion and achieved almost perfect identification.\n",
      "In conclusion, the NanoString nCounter is an efficient platform for measuring multiple RNA markers per body fluid and will be useful for forensic RNA analysis.\n",
      "RNA analysis has emerged as a reliable method of body fluid identification for forensic use [1-7].\n",
      "Conventionally, immunological, enzymatic, and chemical detection of specific protein markers is used [8-10].\n",
      "For example, prostate-specific antigen has been used for semen and hemoglobin for blood identification [9, 10].\n",
      "These assays provide important information for crime scenes, but they can provide wrong information because of cross-reactions.\n",
      "Recently, several body fluid-specific mRNA markers have been discovered [1-7]: β-spectrin (SPTB), porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), and hemoglobin alpha locus 1 (HBA1) for blood; matrix metalloproteinase 7 and 11 (MMP7 and MMP11) for menstrual blood; statherin (STATH) and histatin 3 (HTN3) for saliva; kallikrein 3 (KLK3) and protamine 1 and 2 (PRM1 and PRM2) for semen; and human beta-defensin 1 (HBD-1) and mucin 4 (MUC4) for vaginal secretion [11].\n",
      "After DNA/RNA co-extraction methods were applied to the forensic field, RNA analysis has become routine forensic analysis [12, 13].\n",
      "RNA expression level is generally measured using reverse-transcription and standard end-point PCR (RT-PCR) or quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in a forensic lab.\n",
      "Recently, using microarray platforms, body fluid-specific mRNA markers were identified at a genome-wide level [14-16], and multiplex qRT-PCR probes of these markers were developed for one-step identification of body fluid type [7, 16].\n",
      "Currently, most of the multiplex qRT-PCR assays use a single marker for each body fluid.\n",
      "However, using a single marker for each body fluid may lead to false positive/negative identification, as some markers are expressed in more than two types of body fluid [4-6].\n",
      "Recently, Roeder and Haas [17] suggested a novel approach of using a minimum of five mRNA markers for each body fluid and a scoring method based on multiple markers.\n",
      "In this regard, the multiplex qRT-PCR system is not useful, because the number of fluorescent dyes in one reaction is limited.\n",
      "The NanoString nCounter (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) is a recent platform that can quantify the expression of hundreds of mRNAs in a single reaction using color-coded molecular barcodes [18, 19].\n",
      "NanoString nCounter is also known as a sufficiently robust method to measure expression in degraded RNA samples, such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and crude tissue lysates [18, 20].\n",
      "Therefore, applying NanoString nCounter to forensic identification of body fluids enables the digital quantification of multiplexed markers for each body fluid.\n",
      "In this study, we adopted the NanoString nCounter and designed a panel of NanoString probes for multiple markers for each body fluid.\n",
      "We tested the multiple markers in a large number of body fluid samples.\n",
      "As a result, we found that the new multiplexed method could improve the specificity and sensitivity of identification.\n",

      "To validate the mRNA candidates as body fluid specific markers, NanoString technology was employed.\n",
      "Color-coded barcodes that represented a single target mRNA were synthesized, targeting 18 body fluid-specific mRNA markers, and 2 endogenous controls for mRNA.\n",
      "Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA was hybridized to the barcode, and then probe-mRNA complexes were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated cartridge according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n",
      "Subsequently, the cartridges were placed in the digital analyzer, and barcodes were counted.\n",
      "All the counts were normalized by the count of GAPDH barcodes.\n",

      "\n",
      "We applied student's t-test to evaluate the significance of gene expression differences between the tissue of interest and the other three tissues among the four body fluids.\n",
      "We applied receive operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each marker, using the ROCR package [21] of R software (version 2.6.1).\n",
      "Again, the four body fluids were divided into two groups: a tissue of interest and the remaining three tissues among the four body fluids.\n",
      "Results with a p-value of < 0.05 were considered significant.\n",
      "Previously, we found a dozen mRNA markers and developed multiplex qRT-PCR probes for body fluid identification [16].\n",
      "But, most of the markers, except pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), were not perfect in terms of area under the curve (AUC) value (AUC, 1).\n",
      "To improve the accuracy of identification, we considered a multiplexed assay using multiple probes for each body fluid.\n",
      "While the multiplex qRT-PCR system is limited by the number of available dyes in a reaction, the NanoString nCounter can measure the expression of hundreds of RNAs at once [18].\n",
      "So, we adopted the NanoString nCounter as the multiplexed identification method using multiple RNA markers for each body fluid.\n",
      "After designing NanoString probes for 18 mRNA markers (four to five for each body fluid and two for controls), we performed NanoString nCounter assays with a total of 12 RNA samples for each body fluid.\n",
      "As a result, we got a dozen good probes (Fig.1) according to the following criteria: 1) p < 0.005 and 2) body fluid-specific expression pattern.\n",
      "Results of the other probes are shown in Supplementary Fig.1.\n",
      "To test the value of each marker as a body fluid-specific marker, we performed ROC analysis (Fig.2).\n",
      "For blood- or semen-specific markers, the identification accuracy was perfect (AUC, 1).\n",
      "But, for saliva and vaginal secretion, no single marker showed perfect accuracy (Fig.2).\n",
      "To improve the accuracy of saliva and vaginal secretion identification, we tried a combination of markers using logistic regression analysis [22].\n",
      "We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of each marker and then evaluated the performance of the combined markers (Fig.3).\n",
      "For saliva and vaginal identification, using two markers significantly improved the identification accuracy (Table 1).\n",
      "Therefore, we could identify each body fluid with multiple makers for each body fluid using the NanoString nCounter quite accurately.\n",
      "Previously, we developed multiplex qRT-PCR probes that used one specific mRNA marker for each body fluid [16].\n",
      "In that work, blood was perfectly identified using a single marker, PPBP.\n",
      "However, for other body fluids, such as vaginal secretion and saliva, it was difficult to find out markers that perfectly discriminated them from other body fluids.\n",
      "For example, as saliva and vaginal secretion showed similar expression patterns, many selected body fluid-specific markers were expressed in both body fluids.\n",
      "This problem led us to consider a combination of multiple markers for perfect identification.\n",
      "A limit in the number of markers that can be assessed in a reaction was the biggest problem when we considered the use of multiple markers for each body fluid.\n",
      "As the number of different fluorescent dyes available in a qRT-PCR reaction is limited (i.e., five), we considered a new method that can measure at least 10 RNAs at once.\n",
      "Fortunately, the recently developed NanoString nCounter allowed us to measure hundreds of probes in a single reaction; so, we adopted the NanoString platform in our body fluid identification project.\n",
      "Measuring the expression of multiple makers per body fluid has a big advantage.\n",
      "As we have shown, by using two markers for each body fluid, we could identify saliva and vaginal secretions that were not identified perfectly by a single marker.\n",
      "As we could identify blood and semen perfectly using only one marker per body fluid, we conclude that a total of 10 markers is enough to identify four different body fluids in one reaction.\n",

      "Adenosine receptors (AdoRs) belong to a family of rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs, which constitute the largest portion of GPCRs in humans, including olfactory receptors, and there are four known subtypes of AdoRs-namely, AdoR1, AdoRA2A, AdoRA2B, and AdoR3 [3, 4].\n",

      "We can tell the regional difference between agonists and antagonists in the dendrogram and also find that the information from the CIMVF analysis can play a role in the discrimination of agonists from antagonists in AdoR agonism.\n",
      "The discreteness of CIMVF data seems to facilitate the performance of the binary classification of AdoR ligands.\n",
      "To find the topological difference between dendrograms, similarity scores between every two dendrograms were shown in Table 2.\n",
      "The similarity between two dendrograms was represented as a percentage.\n",

      "The value has the highest similarity among all comparisons.\n",
      "A distance meta-tree build from five dendrograms of 46 AdoR ligands was illustrated in Fig.3.\n",

      "Title: Membrane Proteins Involved in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Tumor Invasion: Studies on TMPRSS4 and TM4SF5\n",
      "\n",
      "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one mechanism by which cells with mesenchymal features can be generated and is a fundamental event in morphogenesis.\n",
      "Recently, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells from the primary tumor are now thought to be initiated by the developmental process termed the EMT, whereby epithelial cells lose cell polarity and cell-cell interactions, and gain mesenchymal phenotypes with increased migratory and invasive properties.\n",
      "The EMT is believed to be an important step in metastasis and is implicated in cancer progression, although the influence of the EMT in clinical specimens has been debated.\n",
      "This review presents the recent results of two cell surface proteins, the functions and underlying mechanisms of which have recently begun to be demonstrated, as novel regulators of the molecular networks that induce the EMT and cancer progression.\n",
      "Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in most cancer types.\n",
      "As an initial step in cancer metastasis, epithelial tumor cells in general disseminate from a primary solid tumor mass and invade into the surrounding stromal tissues.\n",
      "Invasion is enhanced by tumor cell activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [1, 2, 3, 4].\n",
      "The EMT is characterized by the loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity and cell-cell contacts, modulation of cell-matrix adhesion, enhanced proteolytic activity, cytoskeletal remodeling, and acquisition of the ability to migrate and invade the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1, 3].\n",
      "During the EMT, epithelial cells undergo molecular changes; epithelial cells gradually lose their epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, ZO-1, and cytokeratins, and concomitantly acquire mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, and alpha smooth muscle actin [1, 3].\n",
      "The EMT plays a critical role in the formation of various tissues and organs, such as the mesoderm, neural crest, heart, secondary palate, and peripheral nervous systems, during embryonic development and wound healing in adult organism [2, 4].\n",
      "Furthermore, the EMT is implicated in pathological processes, such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis and organ fibrosis [2].\n",
      "One of the hallmarks of the EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin, which is currently thought to be a metastasis suppressor [5].\n",
      "Downregulation of E-cadherin is usually mediated by E-cadherin transcriptional repressors/EMT-inducing transcription factors, including the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger factors (Snail and Slug), the ZEB family (ZEB1 and ZEB2), and basic helix-loop-helix factors (Twist1 and E47), which have been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [4, 5].\n",
      "These factors repress transcription of E-cadherin by interacting with proximal E-box elements in the E-cadherin promoter [5].\n",
      "In addition, these E-cadherin repressors may be directly or indirectly involved in the upregulation of certain mesenchymal genes [5], although the precise mechanism of this regulation is largely unknown.\n",
      "The EMT is triggered by soluble growth factors, such as members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and fibroblast growth factor families, epidermal growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [3, 4].\n",
      "Subsequent activation of receptor-mediated signaling triggers the activation of intracellular effector molecules, such as members of the small GTPase family, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization, and also results in the activation of EMT-inducing transcription factors [3, 4].\n",
      "In addition, components of the ECM, such as collagen, and activation of integrin co-receptors are also involved in the EMT process [3].\n",
      "Certain proteases are sufficient to induce the EMT [2]; for example, matrix metalloproteinase-3 triggers the EMT by increasing the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, which in turn induces Snail expression [6].\n",
      "Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been identified as a novel class of EMT regulators; miRs that negatively regulate the EMT include miR-153, -155, -194, -25, -212, and -200, and miRs that positively regulate the EMT include miR-29a, -103/107, -150, and -221/22 [7].\n",
      "miRs regulate invasion and metastasis by targeting the transcripts of various genes involved in the EMT event, including EMT-inducing transcription factors.\n",
      "For example, members of the miR-200 family are negative regulators of the EMT and are essential for maintenance of the epithelial status through the downregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2.\n",
      "In turn, miR-200 members are transcriptionally repressed by ZEB1 and ZEB2, thus establishing a double-negative feedback loop [8].\n",
      "The EMT was recently shown to be linked to stemness and self-renewal capacity [9, 10].\n",
      "In cases of breast cancer stems, the linkage among EMT phenotype, stemness, and drug resistance has been well studied [11].\n",
      "Further, epithelialmesenchymal plasticity (consisting of EMT and MET) is also described in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [12, 13, 14].\n",
      "CTCs with various degrees of EMT phenotypes are found during breast cancer metastasis [15].\n",
      "Therefore, CTCs may involve self-renewal capacity, which is linked to the EMT, during cancer metastasis [16].\n",
      "Title: Introduction to type II transmembrane serine proteases\n",
      "\n",
      "Dysregulation of proteases is a hallmark of cancer progression; thus, proteases in general have been the subject of numerous cancer studies.\n",
      "Extracellular proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases, contribute to tumor cell invasion and metastasis through both direct proteolytic activity and the regulation of cellular signaling and functions [17, 18, 19].\n",
      "Most members of the serine protease family are either secreted or sequestered in cytoplasmic organelles awaiting signal-regulated release.\n",
      "Recently, type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) have been recognized as a new subfamily of serine proteases that have in common an extracellular proteolytic domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, a short intracellular domain, and a variable-length stem region containing modular structural domains [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\n",
      "Enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase), identified over a century ago due to its pivotal role in food digestion, is the first TTSP, which was revealed by molecular cloning of the enteropeptidase cDNA two decades ago [25].\n",
      "TMPRSS2, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), corin, and matriptase have been subsequently identified as cell surface-associated proteases [23, 24].\n",
      "To date, 20 TTSPs have been identified in mouse and humans due to the analysis of sequence data from mammalian genome projects [23].\n",
      "Analysis of the tissue distribution of TTSPs and gene targeting in mice of certain TTSPs suggested that a significant number of TTSPs may have important functions in embryonic development and homeostasis of mammalian tissues, such as heart, skin, inner ear, placenta, and digestive tract [23, 24].\n",
      "Most TTSPs are overexpressed in a variety of tumors compared to normal tissues, implicating their potential as novel markers of tumor development and progression and possible molecular targets for anti-cancer therapeutics [23, 26].\n",
      "Recently, a number of works have focused on the evaluation of the expression of individual TTSPs during tumor progression and on the investigation of the potential roles of these proteases in tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [23, 27].\n",
      "Title: TMPRSS4 in cancer\n",

      "TMPRSS4 (gene ID, 56649; chromosomal location, 11q23.3), initially referred to as TMPRSS3, was originally identified as a gene expressed in most pancreatic cancer tissues but not in the normal pancreas or chronic pancreatitis [28].\n",
      "To date, 7 isoforms have been reported.\n",
      "The deduced sequence of 437 amino acids of the longest isoform (isoform 1) contains a serine protease domain with putative trypsin-like activity and a transmembrane domain [28].\n",
      "In human, TMPRSS4 mRNA was detected in bladder, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and kidney [28], although the physiological roles of TMPRSS4 remain unknown.\n",
      "Furthermore, TMPRSS4 expression was upregulated in malignant compared to benign thyroid neoplasm and was suggested as both a diagnostic and prognostic marker [29, 30].\n",
      "TMPRSS4 was associated with poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous cell histology [31], triple-negative breast cancer [32], cervical cancer [33], and gastric cancer patients [34].\n",

      "[35] reported that TMPRSS4 mRNA levels were upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues versus adjacent normal mucosa.\n",
      "The authors also reported that TMPRSS4 protein expression was significantly higher in human colorectal cancer tissues from advanced stages (52.5% and 50.0% of stages III and IV, respectively) than in that of early stage (6.3% in stage I), suggesting that TMPRSS4 may play a role in the progression of non-invasive tumors to invasive malignancies [35].\n",
      "Jia et al.\n",
      "[36] showed that the inhibitory tripeptide tyroserleutide led to downregulation of TMPRSS4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thereby reducing the invasion and metastasis of HCC induced by irradiation.\n",
      "Taken together, TMPRSS4 may be a novel biomarker for the prognosis of certain types of cancers and could be employed for diagnostics and therapeutics.\n",
      "On the other hand, the mechanism by which TMPRSS4 expression is modulated has not been well characterized.\n",
      "Recently, Nguyen et al.\n",
      "[37] reported that TMPRSS4 was increased in NSCLC cells under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment may upregulate TMPRSS4 expression.\n",
      "Title: Function of TMPRSS4 in the regulation of EMT and invasion\n",
      "\n",
      "In colon cancer cells, TMPRSS4 induces downregulation of E-cadherin and leads to EMT events, accompanying morphological changes and actin reorganization [38].\n",
      "Suppression of TMPRSS4 by siRNA reduces cell invasion in colon and lung cancer cells, while overexpression TMPRSS4 induces migration, invasion, and metastasis [38].\n",
      "Attachment and spreading of cells on the ECM, with concomitant formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, is a prerequisite for cell migration.\n",
      "TMPRSS4 also modulates cell-matrix adhesion and cell spreading mainly through modulation of integrins, such as α5β1, which has been centrally implicated in the EMT and cell motility [39, 40], which probably contributes to enhanced motility and invasiveness.\n",
      "One of the molecular mechanisms by which TMPRSS4 mediates the EMT and invasiveness in tumor cells is that TMPRSS4 mediates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway activation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, mainly through integrin α5 upregulation, leading to the EMT and invasiveness.\n",
      "Furthermore, TMPRSS4 overexpression in human colorectal cancer tissues positively correlates with enhanced expression of integrin α5 and inversely correlates with E-cadherin expression, confirming that TMPRSS4 modulates expression of EMT markers.\n",
      "Recently, Larzabal et al.\n",
      "[41] reported that miR-205 is involved in TMPRSS4-induced integrin α5 expression in NSCLC cells.\n",
      "To further implicate TMPRSS4 in the EMT, Cheng et al.\n",
      "[42] suggested that interactions between HGF activator inhibitor (HAI-1) and TMPRSS4 contribute to EMT events, including E-cadherin reduction and morphological changes in pancreatic cancer cells.\n",
      "In addition, TMPRSS4-induced E-cadherin reduction and EMT play a critical role in radiation-induced long-term metastasis of residual HCC in nude mice [43].\n",
      "Interaction of TMPRSS4 and integrin α5, based on the observation that TMPRSS4 partially interacts with integrin α5 under certain coimmunoprecipitation conditions in a cell line-dependent manner [35] (Kim S, unpublished observation), suggests the possibility that TMPRSS4 may modulate or participate in the interaction of integrin and other cell surface proteins (for example, tetraspanin, receptor tyrosine kinases, etc.\n",
      "), leading to subsequent signaling transduction activation.\n",
      "In fact, TMPRSS4 can interact with urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR; CD87) [44], which can induce the EMT in hypoxic breast cancer cells [45], although it is not clear whether TMPRSS4 interacts with uPAR directly or via integrin(s).\n",
      "Loss or reduction of E-cadherin expression is a well-known hallmark of the EMT and correlates positively with tumor cell invasion and metastasis [3].\n",
      "TMPRSS4 appears to modulate SIP1/ZEB2 expression, based on the observation that SIP1 mRNA is upregulated in TMPRSS4-overexpressing colon cancer cells, although induction of SIP1 at the protein level remains to be determined.\n",
      "Therefore, it is possible that SIP1 mediates TMPRSS4-induced EMT events, including E-cadherin reduction.\n",
      "Several studies have shown that suppression of high endogenous E-cadherin expression renders non-invasive cells partially invasive [46], whereas reconstitution of E-cadherin results in tumor cell reversion from an invasive mesenchymal phenotype to a benign epithelial phenotype [46, 47].\n",
      "In contrast, other studies have shown that ectopic expression of E-cadherin could not reverse EMT phenotypes induced by the transcription factor Twist1 [10].\n",
      "On the other hand, downregulation of E-cadherin was required for TMPRSS4-mediated EMT and invasion in colon cancer cells but was not sufficient for induction of these phenotypes [35], suggesting that downregulation of E-cadherin is not the sole contributor to TMPRSS4-mediated phenotypes.\n",
      "In this respect, upregulation of specific mesenchymal markers, such as integrin α5, besides the downregulation of E-cadherin by TMPRSS4, may be required for full invasiveness during colon cancer progression (Fig.1).\n",
      "Title: Molecular mechanisms and signals regulated by TMPRSS4\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous studies have focused on the investigation of in vivo substrates of TTSPs.\n",
      "However, few studies have conclusively addressed the in vivo molecular targets and function of TTSPs during tumor progression.\n",
      "In vitro, several TTSPs, including matriptase, were shown to activate prourokinase plasminogen activator, pro-macrophage stimulating protein-1, and pro-HGF, which are implicated in the proliferation, migration and invasion of various cancer cell types [23].\n",
      "Like most of the members of the TTSP family, TMPRSS4 can activate epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in vitro through its proteolytic activity, possibly regulating sodium and water flux across high-resistance epithelia [48, 49].\n",
      "TMPRSS4 induces cancer cell invasion in a manner that is dependent on serine proteolytic activity [38], and inhibitory compounds against TMPRSS4 serine protease activity were reported to reduce colon cancer cell invasion [50].\n",
      "However, it remains unknown which precursor substrates are cleaved by TMPRSS4 to contribute to tumor progression.\n",
      "On the other hand, it has recently been reported that TMPRSS4 induces urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) gene expression through activation of the transcription factors AP-1, Sp1, and Sp3 in mainly a JNK-dependent manner in prostate and lung cancer cells but not in colon cancer cells [44].\n",
      "uPA is a well-known serine protease involved in invasion and metastasis and correlates with poor prognosis in breast, lung, stomach, bladder, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancers [51], and TMPRSS4 expression significantly correlates with uPA expression in human lung and prostate adenocarcinomas [44].\n",
      "In addition, TMPRSS4-mediated uPA expression contributes to prostate cancer cell invasion (Fig.1) [44].\n",
      "It is intriguing that TMPRSS4 activates JNK signaling pathways, possibly through its association with uPAR, leading to uPA expression.\n",

      "Similar to tetraspanins (i.e., transmembrane 4 superfamily, TM4SFs), TM4SF5 has four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), short cytoplasmic domains at their N- and C-termini, an ICL between TM2 and TM4, two extracellular loops, a smaller extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2, and a larger extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 [61, 62].\n",
      "Recent clinical studies separately report that TM4SF5 is highly expressed in tumors from deceased breast cancer patients, compared to those from 10-year breast cancer survivors [67], and that postoperative 5-year overall survival of esophageal cancer patients negatively correlates with TM4SF5 expression [68].\n",

      "Therefore, by virtue of the protein complex formation, overexpressed TM4SF5 in cancer cells can influence or activate diverse intracellular signaling pathways for cell adhesion, proliferation, the EMT, migration, and invasion for tumor progression and maintenance.\n",
      "TM4SF5 is shown to associate with integrins α2, β1 [70, 71], α5 [72], and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [73, 74] during cell migration [70, 71], angiogenesis [72], drug resistance [74], and fibrosis [73].\n",

      "TM4SF5 expression is achieved by TGFβ1-mediated Smad actions on EGFR activation [73], such that the important roles of the multifunctional cytokine TGFβ1 in the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the EMT are confirmed in a development of murine liver fibrosis.\n",
      "Since liver fibrosis can eventually lead to hepatocarcinoma at a high rate of over 70% [82], the roles of TM4SF5 in the development of both fibrosis and tumorigenesis in the liver can be reasonable.\n",

      "Further, TM4SF5-mediated invasive ECM degradation requires direct interaction between the COOH-terminus of TM4SF5 and c-Src, which is linked to Tyr845 phosphorylation of EGFR to form more invasive protrusions [76].\n",
      "TM4SF5-mediated multilayer growth [74], FAK activity, migration, and invasion [75] are abolished by an anti-TM4SF5 reagent, TSAHC (a synthetic compound), which appears to affect its N-glycosylation and at the same time block induction of the TM4SF5-dependent EMT phenotype and multilayer growth [83].\n",

      "p27Kip1 can be phosphorylated by Akt, KIS, or JNK [90, 91, 92], resulting in translocalization and stabilization in the cytosol, where it binds to and inactivates RhoA GTPase, leading to alterations in actin organization and motility regulation [93].\n",
      "TM4SF5 expression also causes overexpression of p27Kip1, although how it occurs is unknown; TM4SF5 causes Akt-mediated Ser10 phosphorylation of p27Kip1, leading to its stabilization, RhoA activity changes, and eventually morphological elongation for the EMT and contact inhibition loss [74].\n",
      "JNK-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation in a TM4SF5-dependent manner also results in localization of p27Kip1 at cell-cell contacts [91], possibly leading to altered actin organization at cell-cell contacts.\n",
      "In addition, inhibition of the proteasome in terms of activity and subunit expression also depends on TM4SF5 expression, resulting in morphological changes and the EMT, suggesting another novel mechanism for TM4SF5-mediated EMT [79].\n",
      "Meanwhile, TM4SF5 causes activation of the FAK/c-Src signaling pathways, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 for the induction and secretion of VEGF, which can stimulate neighboring endothelial cells for enhanced (tumor) angiogenesis [72].\n",
      "During modeling of the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells overexpressing TM4SF5 appear to negatively regulate expression of the cytokine IL6, and exogenous IL6 treatment leads to less STAT3 signaling activation in TM4SF5-positive cancer cells (Ryu J and Lee JW, in revision); thus, TM4SF5-dependent suppression of IL6 can be a strategy for TM4SF5-positive tumor cells to avoid pro-immunological actions by IL6 secreted by neighboring immune cells.\n",
      "As for invasion, TM4SF5 expression also increases the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2, in addition to its activity [77].\n",

      "\n",
      "After the initial enthusiasm of the human genome project, it became clear that without additional data pertaining to the epigenome, i.e., how the genome is marked at specific developmental periods, in different tissues, as well as across individuals and species-the promise of the genome sequencing project in understanding biology cannot be fulfilled.\n",
      "This realization prompted several large-scale efforts to map the epigenome, most notably the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project.\n",
      "While there is essentially a single genome in an individual, there are hundreds of epigenomes, corresponding to various types of epigenomic marks at different developmental times and in multiple tissue types.\n",
      "Unprecedented advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, by virtue of low cost and high speeds that continue to improve at a rate beyond what is anticipated by Moore's law for computer hardware technologies, have revolutionized molecular biology and genetics research, and have in turn prompted innovative ways to reduce the problem of measuring cellular events involving DNA or RNA into a sequencing problem.\n",
      "In this article, we provide a brief overview of the epigenome, the various types of epigenomic data afforded by NGS, and some of the novel discoveries yielded by the epigenomics projects.\n",
      "We also provide ample references for the reader to get in-depth information on these topics.\n",
      "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has resulted in an exponential growth in data in the past decade, primarily fueled by the general interest of the scientific community in functionally annotating the human genome.\n",
      "The power of high-throughput parallel sequencing was deployed to characterize human genetic variation, in an international effort launched in 2008, called the 1000 Genomes Project, with the hope that such a large-scale endeavor would help in identifying all the underlying genetic differences that lead to disease resistance/susceptibility [1].\n",
      "In the meantime, based on numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it was realized that 93% of the trait-associated polymorphisms within the human population were located in non-coding regions, potentially within cis-regulatory elements [2].\n",
      "In fact, in the mid-1970s, King and Wilson [3] pointed out the importance of mapping regulatory events and hinted that a small difference in the time/level of activation of a single gene could influence overall systemic development.\n",
      "They estimated the genetic distance between human and chimpanzee to be much smaller than the corresponding genetic distance between the sibling species of Drosophila, thereby underscoring the need to explore regulatory/expression differences at different times as a basis to explain the evolutionary differences at the organismal level [3].\n",
      "A mechanistic understanding of spatio-temporal gene expression in eukaryotes is far from complete.\n",
      "While genetic differences might be expected to explain expression divergence across species and expression variability across individuals of a population, it cannot explain how almost-identical genomes in more than 200 different cell types within an individual organism can drive such varied expression profiles specific to each cell type [4].\n",
      "DNA is packaged in a nucleoprotein complex structure called chromatin that is highly dynamic, in that its \"states\" vary from one cell type to another.\n",
      "Therefore, a possible solution to this conundrum is to analyze these \"states\" at the genome level, i.e., characterize the landscape of the epigenome, which further qualifies and modulates the functional effect of genetic information [5].\n",
      "Epigenome, meaning \"on or above genomes,\" refers to such sequence-independent heritable properties of the genome that can modulate the functional output of the genome.\n",
      "While, as described initially, heritability is an important qualifying criterion of an epigenomic mark (most notably, DNA methylation) [6], currently, the term epigenome is loosely used to encompass a myriad of chemical changes to DNA or histone proteins, chromatin accessibility, small and long (non-coding) RNA localization, and higher-order DNA organization (including nucleosome occupancy and positioning, and 3D chromatin interactions) (Fig.1) [7,8,9].\n",
      "The ultimate combined effect of the epigenome is to determine the transcriptome (the set of all transcripts) of a cell precisely.\n",
      "Epigenomic features influence the regulatory program of each gene's expression in several ways: they define the local environment of specific processes by regulating the chromatin architecture, determine access of transcription factors to DNA, as well as serve to keep a \"memory\" of cell type-specific features facilitating heritability of epigenetic characteristics [10, 11].\n",
      "The will of the global scientific community to sequence the human genome spurred advances in sequencing technologies that led to what is now known as NGS.\n",
      "The improvement in cost and speed of sequencing in the last decade has significantly surpassed the analogous improvement in computer technologies as predicted by Moore's law [12].\n",
      "Well beyond the initial goal of sequencing complete genomes of several species, NGS is now routinely used as a tool to investigate the diverse array of cellular events involving DNA or RNA, such as the identification of genomic loci bound by a specific protein, the detection of pairs of spatially proximal or interacting chromosomal loci, etc.\n",
      "Broad availability of NGS technologies has led to a paradigm shift in molecular biology research; from probing singular cellular events to an unbiased genome-scale mapping of such events, and has enabled genome-wide elucidation of the epigenomic landscapes in hundreds of cell types, across developmental times, in human, as well as other species [13].As mentioned earlier, it is the locus-specific \"epigenetic code\" (a specific signature or combination of several epigenetic modifications) that helps define a cell's expression program and identity [14], thereby distinguishing it from other cell types.\n",
      "Unlike the largely static genome of an individual, the epigenome is highly variable and dynamic; yet, many of these marks can be passed down a cell's lineage, or from one generation to the next.\n",
      "In this section, we describe several well-studied epigenomic marks and outline what is known about their role in gene expression modulation.\n",
      "We will also outline various NGS-based assays that are used in comprehensively mapping each of the epigenetic marks (Table 1) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].\n",
      "Title: DNA methylation\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the more stable and heritable epigenetic marks is DNA methylation.\n",
      "The human genome is highly methylated; approximately 80% of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are chemically modified at their fifth carbon atom with a methyl group [35].\n",
      "Historically, DNA methylation was associated with transcriptional silencing (as evidenced by many promoter-based studies) [36].\n",
      "Although genome-scale profiling of this epigenetic mark revealed that in some instances DNA methylation is correlated with transcriptional activation, it is enriched in the gene bodies of active genes [37].\n",
      "Thus, the associations between an epigenomic mark and functional output may be location-specific, thereby complicating their functional interpretation.\n",
      "The available assays for identifying methylated CpG dinucleotides in a genome vary in terms of resolution and cost.\n",
      "Restriction enzyme-based assays (e.g., methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing) involve the digestion of genomic DNA with several methylation-sensitive enzymes [15], followed by sequencing of digested fragments.\n",
      "Affinity-based enrichment assays, such as methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein sequencing [16, 17], selectively target methylated fragments (usually up to 100 bp) using an antibody, followed by sequencing of those fragments.\n",
      "Both these methods are low-resolution and essentially qualitative.\n",
      "Chemical modification methods, such as bisulfite sequencing (BS), have higher resolution and provide quantitative estimates of methylation.\n",
      "They exploit the fact that when treated with sodium bisulfite, unmethylated cytosines convert to uracil while methylated cytosines do not.\n",
      "Thus, mapping of sequenced fragments reveals the quantitative estimate of methylation at each CpG locus.\n",
      "The two variations to BS include reduced representation BS and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or methylC-seq (whole-genome BS); the former employs restriction enzyme digestion to target certain regions of interest prior to sodium bisulfite treatment [18], whereas the latter couples the chemical treatment with whole-genome sequencing [19].\n",
      "Upon the discovery that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC: an intermediate produced during active DNA demethylation) and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) are both resistant to bisulfite treatment, it became critical to distinguish between the different methyl variants, including 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine.\n",
      "To this end, oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq) was invented as an improvement for methylC-seq to measure single base-pair resolution methylation levels of 5-mC [20].\n",
      "This is accomplished by oxidizing 5-hmCs (using potassium perruthenate) before sodium bisulfite treatment, such that they are now sensitive to the subjected chemical conversion to uracil, thus ensuring that the remaining cytosines are all 5-mCs.\n",
      "Title: Histone modifications\n",
      "\n",
      "Chromosomal DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, essentially composed of 4 kinds of subunits; viz., H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.\n",
      "These proteins are subject to chemical modifications at specific residues of histone tails; some well-studied modifications include phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination [38].\n",
      "These modifications are involved in setting the stage for directed transcriptional activation and repression by controlling DNA accessibility or recruitment of other protein complexes.\n",
      "This idea has been extended into the \"histone code\" hypothesis [39, 40]-that complex combinations of distinct histone modifications, like H3K27me3 (a mark of repressed regions), H3K4me3 (a mark of gene promoters), and H3K27ac (a mark of transcriptionally active regions), etc.\n",
      "[41], underlie specific transcriptional programs.\n",
      "This notion has been further extended in more recent works into an 'epigenomic code' to include epigenomic marks other than histone modifications [42].\n",
      "Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of DNA-histone complexes is achieved by cross-linking histones with the DNA, digesting the cross-linked DNA, and then using an antibody specific to the N-tail modification of interest (to any of the >100 post-translational modifications to histone tails and globules [43]), followed by sequencing of the purified DNA fragments.\n",
      "This method is called chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and was primarily used to map the genomic locations of DNA-associated proteins.\n",
      "Due to the relatively large fragment size, the mapped sequence reads thus obtained from ChIP-seq [21] provide a low-resolution localization map of modified histones in the genome.\n",
      "An alternative strategy, chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo), uses exonuclease to digest the precipitated DNA fragment from either end to better resolve the modified loci at base-pair resolution [22].\n",
      "Title: Nucleosome positioning and occupancy\n",
      "\n",
      "The packaging of DNA coiled around histones produces distinct structures called nucleosomes that form repeating units with approximately 147 bp wrapped around each unit, separated by varying lengths of linker DNA.\n",
      "The occupancy and periodic positioning of nucleosomes can control the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors [23] and DNases, as well as the transcription rate of active gene bodies [44], and are thus considered an epigenetic mark.\n",
      "Biochemically active regulatory regions are generally depleted of nucleosomes [45], whereas inactive repeat regions (heterochromatin) have higher affinity to form nucleosome structures [46].\n",
      "A map of nucleosome occupancy is generated by using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for digestion of the chromatin [23], followed by high-throughput sequencing-a technique called MNase-seq.\n",
      "MNase digests all linker DNA but preserves the DNA wound around the nucleosome; when the latter is sequenced and mapped to the reference, a map of the original positioning of nucleosomes is obtained.\n",
      "Due to some inherent biases in MNase affinity (preference to AT-rich regions) and the lack of single base-pair resolution data, attempts were made to develop more precise technologies [24].\n",
      "An MNase-independent technique that involves chemically modifying engineered histones to bring about cleavage of DNA wound around histones allows direct mapping of nucleosome centers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Epigenetic mechanisms, such as chromatin accessibility, impact transcription factor binding to DNA, transcriptional specificity, and hence, transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "Open and easily accessible regions of DNA within the chromatin are indicative of local territories of transcriptional activity.\n",
      "Measuring \"openness\" of DNA at different regions genome-wide, based on the DNase hypersensitivity assay, has helped discover several classes of functional elements, like promoters and enhancers [47].\n",
      "It has also aided in identifying cell-type specific behaviors by comparison of accessibility profiles [47].\n",
      "Regions of accessible chromatin are reflective of active regulatory sites.\n",
      "The enzyme DNase I is capable of digesting DNA in nucleosome-depleted regions (i.e., free unwound DNA).\n",
      "Post-digestion sequencing reveals large blocks of DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS) in chromatin (DNase-seq) [25, 48], which, upon further deep sequencing, can reveal up to 40-bp footprints of protected regions (potentially bound by transcription factors).\n",
      "These smaller regions are called digital genomic footprints (DGF) [26].\n",
      "Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing is another technique that, by deep-sequencing random fragments of the genome post-crosslinking, measures the frequency of shearing at different loci, thus quantifying accessibility at high resolution, because free DNA that is unbound by factors is more susceptible to shearing [27].\n",
      "Title: 3D chromatin architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "The array of nucleosomes organized in 30-nm fibers, called chromatin, has diverse functions well beyond mere compaction.\n",
      "Coordinated activity of distal elements is orchestrated by short- and long-range DNA interactions, which is determined by the 3D chromatin structure as well as the local environment of individual genes.\n",
      "For instance, chromatin conformation/looping mediates a promoter's access to its enhancers, thereby determining the transcriptional fate of a gene [49].\n",
      "Spatial proximity can be determined by measuring the interaction frequencies of linearly distal fragments by a suite of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based assays.\n",
      "Chromosomes assume a specific tertiary structure with profound implications for cellular function and fate [49].\n",
      "While the overall chromatin structure cannot be directly measured, measuring spatial distances between pairs of genomic loci has become increasingly more efficient with the arrival of 3C technologies [28].\n",
      "Treatment with formaldehyde crosslinks spatially proximal DNA loci in cells, and then post-digestion, the resulting fragments are allowed to ligate in a weak solution (cross-linked fragments ligate with higher frequency than random fragments).\n",
      "This frequency is quantitatively assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\n",
      "Known loci are selected for by using sequence-specific probes that allow assaying specific pairs of regions in so-called one-versus-one mapping.\n",
      "Circular chromosome conformation capture, or 4C, allows whole-genome mapping of all spatial interactions of one specific region of interest (one-vs-all mapping) [29].\n",
      "Chromosome conformation capture carbon copy, or 5C, deploys several anchors and primers to ensure targeting of several regions at once to attain higher coverage (many-vs-many) [30].\n",
      "Finally, the most recent derivative of 3C, namely Hi-C, permits surveying of the whole genome [31] in a relatively unbiased fashion for frequencies of spatially interacting pairs of loci in the entire genome without restricting the exploration to selected loci.\n",
      "This was done with reasonably high resolution, where the human genome was partitioned into 100-kb blocks and the spatial interaction between every pair of intra-chromosomal regions was assessed, while interchromosomal interactions have been mapped at 1-Mb resolution [31].\n",
      "A variation of Hi-C, called chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), involves a ChIP reaction to isolate chromatin interactions involving regions of DNA that bind to a protein of interest [32].\n",
      "For example, an antibody targeting RNA polymerase II can be used to precipitate interactions involving a promoter and another interacting region, such as a distal enhancer or other promoters [50].\n",

      "Specific classes of non-coding RNA-short RNAs (viz.\n",
      "micro RNA [miRNA], short interfering RNA [siRNA], and piwi-interacting RNA [piRNA]) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)-regulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, influencing several cellular processes, like X chromosome inactivation [51], genomic imprinting [52], and some cellular processes [53], and cancer [54].\n",
      "LncRNAs tether epigenetic complexes capable of methylating DNA and modifying histones to the chromatin, enabling allele- and locus-specific regulation.\n",
      "For example, lncRNA Xist covers the inactive X chromosome and recruits PCR2, a Polycomb complex responsible for trimethylation of H3K27 [51].\n",
      "Furthermore, lncRNAs, by virtue of their length, are suited for orchestrating specific regulatory events particular to a target locus [55].\n",
      "Additionally, miRNA (~22 nucleotides long) have shown to be linked with cancer and can act as either oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes.\n",
      "They can be involved in establishing DNA methylation and regulating histone modification by interacting with their target mRNA to alter chromatin of the corresponding DNA template [56].\n",
      "siRNA, and its interference machinery has also been implicated in the formation of heterochromatin [57].\n",
      "A catalog of small RNAs has been generated by deep sequencing of total RNA from whole transcriptomes using smRNA-seq technology [34].\n",
      "Selection of smRNA can be carried out by sequential ligation of adapters to its unique 5' mono/triphosphate ends, produced as a result of processing the smRNA population in the cell [58].\n",
      "On the other hand, lncRNA are poly-adenylated, and much of the challenge in identifying them from whole-genome mRNA-seq data [33] lies in the computational and analytical domains [59].\n",
      "Spurred by unprecedented advances in sequencing technologies as well as other assays, and a recognition of the potential of NGS in determining the epigenomic landscape, several research consortia have formed to generate genome-wide maps of human epigenomic marks by sharing resources and publishing standard operating procedures, thereby ensuring best practices and high-quality datasets [60].\n",
      "One of the first concerted efforts in this direction was the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project, started in 2003 and funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institute of Health (NIH-NHGRI), which involved hundreds of researchers in dozens of labs across the globe.\n",
      "The ENCODE consortium has performed 1,650 epigenomic profiling on 147 cell lines assessing the transcriptome, transcription factor binding for dozens of transcription factors, chromatin topology, histone modifications, DNA methylation, and more (http://www.encodeproject.org) [13].\n",
      "Five years after launching ENCODE, the NIH funded a second large-scale mapping project called the Roadmap Epigenomics Program.\n",
      "While ENCODE focused on generating data in cell lines, the Roadmap program focuses on mapping epigenomes of high-priority normal human primary tissue and human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cell types.\n",
      "As of May 2012, the Roadmap includes 61 \"complete\" epigenomes (of a variety of cell types) (http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org) [61].\n",
      "The data repository can be accessed interactively at Human Epigenome Atlas (http://www.genboree.org/epigenomeatlas/multiGridViewerPublic.rhtml), via the Washington University Epigenome Browser (http://www.epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser), as well as the UCSC Genome Browser (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu).\n",
      "Further, the NIH Roadmap is one of the members of an even larger consortium called the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC; http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org), formed by institutions in 7 countries.\n",
      "To name a few, BLUEPRINT: a European initiative to generate about 100 reference epigenomic maps; the CREST/IHEC team in Japan: to produce reference epigenomes specializing in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and cells of reproductive organs; and the Epigenomic Platform Program: a Canadian program to map epigenomic variations in disease cells.\n",
      "Together, these efforts are expected to generate over 1,000 reference human epigenomes.\n",
      "Other epigenome mapping efforts focused on specific disease areas have also been undertaken.\n",
      "These include the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), funded by the NIH in 2006 [62], which is a part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC; http://www.icgc.org) that was officially put together in 2008.\n",
      "By providing a rich functional annotation of the genome, the numerous epigenomic datasets have significantly improved our ability to probe the mechanisms of gene regulation as well as shed light on disease processes mediated by perturbation of normal regulatory processes.\n",
      "A collection of 30 scientific reports published with the initial release of the ENCODE data provides a detailed report of the initial integrative analysis of the epigenomics data [47, 63, 64, 65, 66].\n",
      "At a basic level, the data have revealed epigenomic signatures of a variety of functional elements, thus significantly enriching their annotation.\n",
      "For instance, many non-coding RNAs have been successfully annotated as a result of deciphering an epigenomic code specific to their promoters and gene bodies [67, 68].\n",
      "High-throughput profiling of the histone modification HeK4me1 has revealed that it is a characteristic mark of enhancer elements; this, and other correlative marks have enabled the discovery of tens of thousands of cell-specific enhancers [69, 70] in the human genome, drastically improving our ability to probe the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "In fact, chromatin signatures specific to promoters, enhancers, and repressed regions, etc., have all been modeled by computational methods like ChromHMM [42].\n",
      "Furthermore, by isolating footprints of protected DNA present inside blocks of hypersensitive or nucleosome-depleted DNA, a comprehensive list of potential cis-regulatory binding sites/sequences has been identified, despite the lack of specific antibodies or the knowledge of cell-specific regulators [2].\n",
      "Availability of epigenomic data has revived predictive modeling of condition-specific gene expression.\n",
      "For example, Dong et al.\n",
      "[71] generated a 2-step quantitative model that includes genome localization data for 11 histone modifications and 1 histone variant in 7 human cell lines and gene expression data quantified using RNA-seq and cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments of the cell.\n",
      "The Pearson's correlation coefficient between their predicted and measured expression levels in about 78 experiments ranged between 0.6 and 0.9 (median r = 0.83).\n",
      "Natarajan et al.\n",
      "[72] trained a classifier that associates cell-specific TF sequence motif matches in DHS regions with different expression patterns in 19 diverse cell types, thus predicting cell-type specific expression directly from regulatory elements in open chromatin.\n",
      "Prior to the availability of NGS, details of the spatial structure of chromatin and its correlates, as well as its functional impacts were largely uncharted.\n",
      "Characterization of the spatial proximity of distal genomic elements with 3C-derivative assays has revealed a high rate of widespread promiscuous interactions among enhancers and promoters.\n",
      "For instance, more than 40% of promoters interact with multiple distal sites, and this is likely true for enhancers as well [73].\n",
      "The spatial chromatin interaction data have also helped challenge some previously held beliefs that were nevertheless unsupported.\n",
      "For instance, historically, the DNA-binding protein CTCF was known to function, among other things, as an insulator that inhibited the spatial interaction between an enhancer and its target promoter when flanking a CTCF-bound locus.\n",
      "However, recent 5C data showed that almost 60% of all enhancer-promoter interactions happen, despite an intervening CTCF-bound locus [74].\n",
      "In fact, there is increasing evidence that CTCF, along with cohesin is involved in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements, and that these events are reflective of cell-type specific transcriptional programs [75].\n",
      "With the availability of putative genome-wide enhancers along with their cell type-specific activity profile across numerous cell types, it is now possible to investigate an alternate layer of transcriptional regulation represented by a network of distal enhancers that exhibit correlated activities across cell types [76, 77] and jointly underlie correlated expression of functionally linked genes.\n",
      "Such analysis brings forth an alternative view of transcriptional regulation, where instead of a single gene regulated by one or more regulatory elements, one ought to consider the collective of enhancers and genes, co-localized in nuclear space to achieve coexpression of functionally linked genes [78, 79].\n",
      "Epigenomic profiling along the developmental time course from ESCs to differentiated cells has shed light on transcriptional regulatory mechanisms during early development.\n",
      "For instance, comparison of the \"histone code\" between the two developmental timeframes indicates that regions marked by repressive histone marks are generally larger in differentiated cells and that these regions span developmental genes.\n",
      "It was also noted that the same regions are more accessible in ESCs [80, 81], thus suggesting an epigenome-mediated regulation of developmental gene transcription.\n",
      "Precisely how this is accomplished is yet to be clarified.\n",
      "The epigenomic data and the discovery of significant patterns of epigenomic marks associated with specific functional regions have also helped clarify genotype-phenotype association data.\n",
      "Numerous GWAS have revealed several polymorphic loci associated with various diseases [82].\n",
      "However, a mechanistic interpretation of these signals has been hampered by the fact that most of the disease-associated genetic variants reside in non-coding regions with no obvious functional interpretation.\n",
      "By combining epigenomic maps and genetic variants, it was found that these disease-associated variants are enriched within cell type-specific accessible (DHS regions) and active regulatory regions [2].\n",
      "Also, an epigenomic model of cardiac enhancers was shown to provide a better causal interpretation of GWAS signals associated with heart-related traits [83].\n",
      "The slew of epigenetic data has revolutionized our perception of the human genome.\n",
      "Although not all \"epigenetically marked\" regions of the genome are likely to be functional, it is very likely that a large portion is functional-much more than the 5-10% of the genome that is deemed to evolve under purifying selection [84, 85].\n",
      "Analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic data has revealed that almost half of the genome is involved in carrying out specific biochemical functions [13].\n",
      "Where these biochemical functions fit in the big picture, and how they are regulated are still open questions.\n",
      "Another fundamental problem is that the causal relationships among various epigenomic events, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, TF binding, and gene expression, etc., are currently not well understood.\n",
      "Although correlations between these events have been well documented in different contexts, we do not know if one is necessary and/or sufficient to observe another.\n",
      "Before the full potential of NGS in mapping the epigenome can be attained, several technical challenges need to be overcome.\n",
      "For instance, techniques like ChIP-seq, used for profiling transcription factor binding and histone modifications require a large amount of starting material, ranging up to 5 million cells.\n",
      "Collection of such a large population of primary differentiated cells, progenitors, and those from specific developmental stages is inherently hard.\n",
      "Heterogeneity of a cell population is another issue that needs to be resolved.\n",
      "It is challenging to obtain a homogeneous population of cells of a singular type from primary tissues that often contain a heterogeneous population of cell types, and it is this lack of homogeneity that can adversely impact the interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained from analyzing the epigenomic data.\n",
      "Yet, many solutions to tackle the problems above are underway.\n",
      "First, there is the emergence of techniques-like ChIP-nano (nano-scale ChIP), which is a highly sensitive small-scale ChIP-seq protocol with a requirement of <50,000 cells as starting material [86], and single-molecule real-time sequencing [87], which aims at alleviating cell-population effects during mapping specific features.\n",
      "Second, methods that are aimed at the targeted knock-out of epigenetic modifiers, like DNA methyltransferases and histone modification enzymes, at predetermined DNA sequences (using transcription activator-like effector nucleases [TALENs]) [88], can help to better characterize the functional relationships between gene expression and epigenetics, thus providing proof of concept for expression modulation (also called epigenetic editing methods) [89].\n",
      "Also, powerful statistical approaches are being developed to integrate data [42, 90] to resolve some of these fundamental issues.\n",
      "With more epigenomic maps being profiled, and more effective computational approaches being developed, we are inching towards a holistic mechanistic understanding of cellular and organismal processes.\n",
      "A schematic depicting the context of several epigenetic marks on chromatin; ranging from DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning patterns affecting the size and distribution of DNase I hypersensitive sites, transcriptional activity at non-coding sites leading to the production of small and long RNA, chemical modifications of histone moieties (e.g., mono-, di- and tri-methylation of the 4th lysine of the H3 subunit), and chromatin folding to form localized structures in 3D nuclear space (anticlockwise).\n",

      "A visual analysis approach and the developed supporting technology provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing large and complex integrated genomic and biomedical data.\n",
      "This paper presents a methodology that is implemented as an interactive visual analysis technology for extracting knowledge from complex genetic and clinical data and then visualizing it in a meaningful and interpretable way.\n",
      "By synergizing the domain knowledge into development and analysis processes, we have developed a comprehensive tool that supports a seamless patient-to-patient analysis, from an overview of the patient population in the similarity space to the detailed views of genes.\n",
      "The system consists of multiple components enabling the complete analysis process, including data mining, interactive visualization, analytical views, and gene comparison.\n",
      "We demonstrate our approach with medical scientists on a case study of childhood cancer patients on how they use the tool to confirm existing hypotheses and to discover new scientific insights.\n",
      "Among cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer occurring in children and is the driving paradigm for the work presented in this paper.\n",
      "Despite presenting with similar clinical features, ALL patients do not always respond in a similar manner to the same treatment strategies.\n",
      "The underlying complexities of the disease are not always clearly reflected by the clinical presentation or pathological results.\n",
      "Genomic variation, typified by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have considerable influence on how humans develop diseases and respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs, vaccines, and other agents [1].\n",
      "Similarly, gene expression patterns in diagnostic bone marrow can predict the sub-type of pediatric ALL as well as indicate relapse potential [2, 3].\n",
      "The co-regulated activity of genes leads to metabolic actions that are driven by small changes in the expression of a large number of genes rather than large changes in only a few [2].\n",
      "As a result, understanding genomic data and biomedical data (e.g., annotated clinical attributes, treatment details, domain ontologies, and patient's background) is crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of ALL.\n",
      "As a rule, the knowledge discovery process involves the dialog between experts from different domains, including laboratory scientists, biostatisticians, computational biologists, and clinicians.\n",
      "In reality, most techniques were developed based on statistical analysis with simple visualization [4] in an attempt to create techniques that would be applicable in several domains.\n",
      "Basic statistics and visualizations without effective interaction and capabilities to control the visual data mining process are often insufficient for the analysis and exploration processes.\n",
      "Intelligent visualization of complex genomic data will therefore bring the insight of information as well as the discovery of relationships, non-trivial structures, and irregularities that may pertain to the disease course of the patient.\n",
      "Genomic datasets are complex data structures with measurements for millions of SNPs affecting the activity of several thousand genes.\n",
      "These genomic 'attributes' are built into models that inform us about individual patients and allow cross-referencing and determining the interconnections between patients.\n",
      "It is important then to provide adequate tools in order to visualize these models and interactions and to simultaneously examine many attributes in the context of relevant clinical properties that can be measured in real time for the purpose of assessing a patient's clinical course and directing his clinical management.\n",
      "Fundamentally, a large number of attributes need to be reduced to a manageable size so that data visualization techniques can be effectively applied.\n",
      "Typical dimensionality reduction methods applied to microarray data include principle component analysis [5], non-negative matrix factorization [6], multidimensional scaling [7], and local linear embedding [8].\n",
      "The choice of method to apply depends to some extent on the nature of the information expected to be encoded in the dataset, since the quality of the resulting reduced matrices can vary across different datasets.\n",
      "Remarkably, most of the visualization techniques use matrix heatmaps, genomic coordinates, or networks (or pathways metaphor) to represent multidimensional genomic data [9,10,11].\n",
      "- Heatmaps are common graphical representations that are used to present genomics values as matrices of colors.\n",
      "Matrix heatmaps are typically represented as rectangles (such as cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [12] and Caleydo StratomeX [13]) and occasionally as circles (such as CircleMap [14]).\n",
      "- Genomic Coordinates represent oncogenomics data by showing alterations tied to their genomic loci.\n",
      "This approach is only suitable for analyzing the genomic topography of alternations or for inspecting particular genomic loci [9].\n",
      "Typical techniques in this approach are Genomics Viewer [15], UCSC Cancer Denomics Browser [16], and Savant Genome Browser [17].\n",
      "- Networks (or graphs) can be used to show changes in state for 1) interpreting and exploring large biological networks and 2) assembly and curation of pathways (such as Cytoscape [18], VANTED [19], VisANT [20], NAViGaTOR [21], and Cerebral [22]).\n",
      "Visualization techniques for gene expression techniques that include reasonably advanced visualizations are presented in [23,24,25].\n",
      "Other good visualization tools show the interdependencies of genes by bringing gene expression into context with pathways [26] or using dimension reduction methods to provide multi-dimensional data visualizations [27].\n",
      "Web-based visual analysis integrates multiple visualization components, such as scatterplot, phylogenetic tree, and genome-wide circus viewer, to enable the analysis [28].\n",
      "Although these tools provide somewhat effective ways for the analysis of data, they do not effectively present the data such that medical analysts can interactively explore and manipulate the information.\n",
      "Our approach seeks to provide a capability for viewing patients in the similarity space based on detailed genomic and gene of interest analysis, representing the underlying biological basis for the disease.\n",
      "This paper presents a novel visual analysis approach and a tool where medical scientists can interrogate large and complex genomic and biological data.\n",
      "We focus on patient-to-patient comparisons through the biological data, including background and treatment, and high-dimensional genomic data, including Affymetrix expression microarrays and Illumina SNP microarrays.\n",
      "The innovation lies in its capability of providing seamless and multiple views of data, from overview of the entire patient population with the similarity space to overviews, detailed views, and genes of interest (GOI) views of selected items, for patient-to-patient comparison.\n",
      "The technology provides various ways to display the multi-dimensional data in cooperation with the automated analysis.\n",
      "In addition, by integrating domain knowledge into the development, we have provided meaningful visualization for medical data analysis as well as a quality assurance tool to verify the effectiveness of the automated analysis.\n",
      "Title: Biological background and data analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression and genomic SNP profiles of 100 pediatric B-cell ALL patients treated at The Children's Hospital at Westmead were generated using Affymetrix expression microarrays (U133A, U133A 2.0, and U133 Plus 2.0) and Illumina NS12 SNP microarrays, respectively.\n",
      "Each Affymetrix expression microarray has 22,277 attributes, while each Illumina SNP microarray has 13,917 attributes.\n",
      "Each attribute was mapped to a probe of DNA (or a gene), and the value for each attribute corresponded to the expression levels or genotype for the gene (each DNA spot contains picomoles (1012 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes or reporters).\n",
      "The annotations for each gene were mapped on separate files.\n",
      "Expression microarrays were hybridized with diagnostic bone marrow samples and genomic microarrays were hybridized with remission peripheral blood samples.\n",
      "The patients were treated following the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich 95 (BFM95) protocol or the complimentary Australian and New Zealand Children's Hematology and Oncology Group Study VIII (Study 8).\n",
      "Using these datasets, we aimed to develop a predictive model of treatment outcome by identifying genes capable of differentiating patients that survived and those that did not.\n",
      "To achieve this, we applied an attribute deletion approach: identifying and removing genes that were almost certainly not involved in a biological phenomenon and patient comparison.\n",
      "We used the attribute importance ranking that was implemented in 'Random forest' [29] to identify these genes.\n",
      "The remaining informative genes were then used to build a similarity space whereby the distances between patients in this space were indicative of genetic similarity.\n",
      "The expression values were z-score-normalized within each platform, concatenated, and z-score-normalized to minimize inter- and intra-platform biases.\n",
      "For the genomic SNP profiles, the theta scores were used to represent genotypes.\n",
      "The two datasets were then concatenated, and 30% of all the patients were withheld from the model-building process as a validation set.\n",
      "Eight bootstraps of the validation set's patients were generated, and for each bootstrap, a random forest was performed.\n",
      "Each random forest produced an attribute ranking list, and we combined these eight lists to create a global list of an attribute's importance.\n",
      "The expression and SNP values for the top 250 genes in this global list were used to create a 3D similarity space using singular value decomposition-a matrix decomposition technique [30].\n",
      "Title: The visual analytics model\n",
      "\n",
      "Our visual analytics model reflects the importance of the domain knowledge in the visual analytics process (see Fig.1).\n",
      "Earlier, we mentioned the importance of validating a method by the outcomes in the discipline that the method is used.\n",
      "To do this, visual analytics must adapt to the respective discipline and conform to the language and norms expected of that discipline.\n",
      "For example, the expression of identified significant genes is required to be validated by the domain experts when the analysis is undertaken in independent laboratories.\n",
      "An appropriate visualization helps the analyst to gain an understanding of the data and construct knowledge through our powerful human visual perception and reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "We provide three interactive views for patient-to-patient comparison, including 1) overviews of the entire patient population in the similarity space, 2) detailed views of selected patients, and 3) GOI.\n",
      "We describe these visualizations in the following sections.\n",
      "Domain analysts should be able to interact and explore through different views to make further discovery of, and insights into, the data.\n",
      "They can obtain a better understanding of the data and their structures and contribute their domain expertise to the knowledge discovery process.\n",
      "From the discovery of new knowledge, the analyst can evaluate, refine, go beyond, and ultimately confirm hypotheses built from previous iterations and automated analysis.\n",
      "The challenge presented to the construction of appropriate visualization is to cover the range of visualizing all of the data but making only all of the relevant data available to the analyst when it is relevant to do so.\n",
      "The presented work was developed with strong involvement from cancer researchers at the Children's Hospital in Westmead, Sydney, Australia, who are experts in ALL research.\n",
      "The philosophy behind the work is that with this new way of looking at genetic and clinical details from the perspectives of both domain knowledge and technologies, visual analytics can provide a medium for the discovery of genetic and clinical problems, potentially leading to improved ALL treatment strategies.\n",
      "Title: Interactive visualization\n",
      "\n",
      "The microarray automated data analysis produced a similarity space of the patients based on their genetic properties.\n",
      "A mapping table of 250 GOI is also created during this process.\n",
      "In order to present these results in a form suitable for visual analysis by medical experts, we have created interactive visualizations that operate with the treated data.\n",
      "The interactive visualization is applied to 1) present a flexible, changeable, and meaningful display of the patient cohort; 2) filter, explore, and manipulate the information; and 3) interactively provide the details of both the original and processed data on demand.\n",
      "Details of the interactive visualization components are presented as follows.\n",
      "Title: Overview of patients\n",
      "\n",
      "The prototype version of the new interactive visualization system provides the set of views addressing the needs described above.\n",
      "The visualization provides a global overview of the entire cohort structure and the relative patient-to-patient comparisons but then allows the analyst to drill into the details of the relationships.\n",
      "Displaying the entire visual structure at once allows analysts to move rapidly to any location in the space.\n",
      "This makes less effort to navigate across the large structures and explore specific parts.\n",
      "We utilized and extended our former works [31, 32] to provide a flexible, simple, yet powerful interface of the patient population in the similarity space.\n",
      "The visualization is capable of displaying both 2D and 3D visual projections of the same structure and switching between them from the same \"area\" in the dataset (see Figs.2 and 3).\n",
      "Although each user might have a different preference, the 2D visualization is normally a better choice, thanks to its simplicity and familiarization to the analyst, its flexibility in interaction and attributed mapping, no obscuration, and perspective correction.\n",
      "The following sections are limited to the 2D version that was extended from TabuVis [31].\n",
      "It is a robust and powerful visual analysis system that provides flexible, customizable, and effective visualization for multidimensional data.\n",
      "Our innovation lies in the ability to provide an easy-to-use yet effective way to view multidimensional data at different angles by mapping various attributes to different visual properties.\n",
      "Key aspects for visually analyzing data with multiple attributes are quality and appropriateness of the analytical platform whose presentation can be adjusted via domain experts.\n",
      "The extended system consists of multiple components enabling the analysis process, including data processing, automatic marks, customizable visualization via interaction, control attributes, filtering, statistical display, save/open works, and many other figures.\n",
      "The overview visualization supports several data types, including Integer, Float, Text (string), Boolean (true/false, yes/no, or 0/1), Date (with various format), Date and Time, and Percentage.\n",
      "The data types are categorized into two groups: Categorical (text and boolean) and Quantitative (integer, float, date, date and time, and percentage).\n",
      "We also map each data type to a color for better identification, particularly text → dark blue, boolean → blue, integer → red, float (and percentage) → orange, and date (and time) → purple.\n",
      "The color scheme can be easily modified via a property file and/or menus when running (see Fig.2).\n",
      "Title: Patient's positions\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's positions are mapped into the 2D space according to his genetic property.\n",
      "This property reflects the genetic similarity of the patients.\n",
      "Two patients are close together if their genes are similar, and conversely, they are located far from each other if their genetic properties are different.\n",
      "For example, Fig.2 clearly illustrates two distinctive groups of patients, marked by the dash-line ovals.\n",
      "The small group contains mostly deceased patients, while the other contains patients that responded well to the treatment and survived the disease.\n",
      "The fact that the deceased patients are located close to each other in the gene space may support the hypothesis that genetic properties are essential to determine whether a patient is likely to respond well in the context of the clinical treatment.\n",

      "The mapping options are label, axes, colors, size, shapes, and visual bars.\n",
      "Title: Filtering\n",

      "From the visualization, users can interactively filter out uninteresting patients to enhance the view of the associated data.\n",
      "Filtering can be applied to all categorical and quantitative attributes through interactive menus.\n",
      "The filtering allows the researcher/clinician (domain expert) to extract, picture, and interrogate specific features for the patients selected within the similarity space.\n",
      "Fig.4 illustrates the view at a navigational stage showing all medium-risk patients only.\n",
      "Patient identifications are also displayed in this example.\n",
      "The figure highlights three patients with similar clinical presentations, such as they were all stratified as medium risk (MR) (blue color), but having diverse outcomes.\n",
      "These patients were managed on the two treatment protocols BFM95 (larger size, ALL48) and Study 8 (smaller size, ALL134 and ALL323).\n",
      "With the patients placed into a similarity space based on genetic data, we have applied further computational methods to extract, visualize, and compare data from the chosen patients.\n",
      "By looking at the figure, we can quickly see that ALL323 is located at the top-left, while the other two patients are positioned closely together at a distance from the first patient.\n",
      "This observation indicates that the two surviving patients ALL48 and ALL134 are genetically similar and that they are genetically different from the deceased patient, ALL323.\n",

      "\n",
      "The system also provides a capability to show and compare the property of a particular probe set across the patient's population.\n",
      "This property allows the analysts to have a comparative view of how a probe set in a gene behaves across the population.\n",
      "Fig.5 shows an example of the visualization of the population that is colored by the value of the probe set \"212022_s_at\" at the gene \"MKI67.\"\n",
      "The figure clearly indicates the significant difference of patients in the bottom-left cluster, which are mostly painted with \"greenish\" colors, corresponding to the high values, in comparison to reddish colors, corresponding to low values.\n",
      "It raises a new hypothesis that the probe set \"212022_s_at\" (or the gene) might play an important role in specifying the similarity space.\n",
      "Title: Clustering\n",
      "\n",
      "We provide a clustering method to group the patients in the similarity space.\n",
      "The clustering is used to enhance the visibility of patients in the space as the groups who are potentially sharing similar genomic properties.\n",
      "In addition, by using a filtering method, the analysts can quickly filter out unwanted clusters for clearer views of the population.\n",
      "We applied the k-means++ clustering algorithm [33] in the implementation.\n",
      "The algorithm was chosen because of its ability of choosing the initial values (or \"seeds\") for the popular k-means clustering algorithm and thus avoiding the sometimes poor clustering outcomes found by the standard k-means algorithm.\n",
      "The number of clusters can be specified via a menu.\n",
      "Fig.6 shows an example of the visualization of the entire patient population who are painted with 4 colors corresponding to 4 clusters.\n",
      "Title: Patient-to-patient visual analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "From the overview of all patients, users can select one or more patients as well as groups of patients to analyze further.\n",
      "At first glance, the analytical view provides full information of both genomic and biological data.\n",
      "The layout of the panels is as follows: 1) the top-left panel displays information of the Affymetrix expression microarrays, 2) the top-right panel displays information of the Illumina SNPs, and 3) the middle table displays all background information of the patients, and the bottom table displays the treatment details (see Fig.7).\n",
      "Each probe set in the gene is represented as a point on the x-y coordinate system.\n",
      "All genes are distributed orderly from top to bottom along the y-coordinate while their values are represented horizontally at the x-coordinate.\n",
      "This visual projection follows the biological rule-the order in which genes are displayed is sorted according to chromosomal order.\n",
      "A quick sort process is performed in prior to the visualization.\n",
      "By providing an overview of the entire genetic and biomedical information, the analysts can identify patterns and abnormalities before exploring further.\n",
      "Fig.7 shows an example of the analytical window of the genetic and clinical data corresponding to patient ALL323.\n",
      "We can see that the Affymetrix expression microarray values of this person vary from -2 to 4, in which the majority of the genes' values are [-1, 0].\n",
      "It is interesting to see that there is a region of loss of heterozygosity in ALL323 (highlighted by the red dash-line rectangle).\n",
      "Following our revised model of the visual analytics process, the analytical exploration is an essential process to discover insight and knowledge.\n",
      "We provide a variety of functions to support the visual exploration and analysis, including highlighting the importance or difference, zooming, filtering, detailing on demand, and comparing multiple patients or groups of patients.\n",
      "A user can interactively highlight GOI and significantly different genes as well as deemphasize the others.\n",
      "This feature allows one to gain a better view of those GOI in comparison with the entire gene structure.\n",
      "The user can also select the option of displaying those GOI only.\n",
      "A semantic zooming technique is applied to zoom in (or zoom out) on any particular area of focus (see Fig.8), which allows the analyst to explore and view in detail the genetic information.\n",
      "The level of details is updated dynamically depending on the amount of focused genes and the size of the windows.\n",
      "This property ensures the best fit of information on the available space.\n",
      "In addition, detailed information of a particular gene is shown when the mouse is over the gene (see Fig.8E and 8F).\n",
      "Fig.8 shows an example of the visualization of patient ALL323 (same as Fig.7) when various options and navigations are applied.\n",
      "In particular, the figure presents the views when a) the GOI are emphasized from the structure, b) the view shows the GOI only, c) the significantly different genes are highlighted, d) the significantly different genes are highlighted within the GOI, e) zoom in is applied to SNP data (at the right panel), and f) the user zooms in on the gene expression data (at the left panel) so that the detailed information of probe sets in the genes is displayed.\n",
      "We also provide a mechanism to compare multiple patients by aligning the analytical windows together.\n",
      "This figure is particularly helpful for identifying the similarities, differences, regularities, and irregularities of the patients.\n",
      "Fig.9 presents the view of genetic and clinical information of the 3 chosen patients (highlighted in Fig.4).\n",
      "First, the complete data of each patient can be directly compared.\n",
      "By way of example, the figure indicates a significant difference of patient ALL323 when compared to the other two patients ALL48 and ALL134-in particular, a region of loss of heterozygosity in ALL323, a region that may contain the genetic differences with ALL134 and ALL48, which may explain the differences in treatment outcome despite being considered similar according to the clinical presentation.\n",
      "We now describe the technical details for visualization of the complete set of SNPs and probe sets for the genes represented by the 250 developed features.\n",
      "Title: Visual analysis of GOI\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional methods usually use heatmaps to show all probe sets or genes in the datasets.\n",
      "Although this approach can show the overview, its visualizations are very dense.\n",
      "It makes it really difficult to analyze those important genes in detail from the crowded population.\n",
      "Our system innovatively focuses the interactive visualization of the GOI resulting from the automated analysis.\n",
      "By reducing the overhead of analyzing a large quantity of genes, the analysts can easily compare the GOI through a large population of patients.\n",
      "The Gene Comparison Interactive Visualization is designed to allow an analyst to drill down further into the genetics and treatment data of patients identified as significant by the processes described in the previous sections.\n",
      "This visualization implements several mechanisms whereby the similarity and differences between patients and groups of patients can be examined in greater detail.\n",
      "An important feature of this interactive visualization is the use of active regions to indicate what the analyst is currently focused on.\n",
      "Knowing this makes it possible to infer what extra information the analyst might find useful and to make sure that it is available.\n",
      "This interactive visualization consists of 5 separate visual components: A) the primary patient probe set heatmap component, B) the gene zoom component, C) the color gradient and Gaussian curve component, D) the gene ontology and probe set annotation component, and E) the patient biomedical data component (see Fig.10).\n",
      "These 5 components are designed to interact with each other as well as other components, including the \"Patient-to-Patient Visual Analysis\" (described in section 6) and the main visualization (described in section 5) in several different ways to assist the analyst to examine the similarities and differences between significant patients and significant groups of patients.\n",
      "Fig.11 presents an overview of the visualization of the entire Genes of Interest Visual Analysis module when the 3 patients highlighted in the similarity space are added.\n",
      "Please note that the figure shows both the probe set heatmap component and the patient information component.\n",
      "The prototype has been used for analyzing the biomedical and genomic datasets of 100 ALL cancer patients, from the perspectives of domain knowledge and technologies.\n",
      "In spite of the size limitation of the dataset due to the expensive data collection, the discovery is quite encouraging in the case of ALL patients.\n",
      "This pilot result will place a foundation, enabling further enhancement and discovery using more comprehensive datasets and/or clinical trials.\n",
      "On the basis that patients who cluster together will have genotypically similar tumors, it is then anticipated that newly diagnosed and as yet untreated patients will be compared directly to local 'biologically' similar neighbors.\n",
      "By comparing the management and treatment outcomes for patients in this manner, the analyst (i.e., clinician) can glean specific information from the local neighbors that will assist with their clinical decision making for the individual patient, moving towards the 'personalization' of medicine.\n",
      "The analysis has partially confirmed this accuracy of the similarity space.\n",
      "To illustrate this, Fig.11A highlights three patients with the red-dash ellipses, where the deceased patient ALL123 is at the top left and the surviving patients ALL26 and ALL302 are located close to each other at the near-bottom right.\n",
      "These patients have similar clinical presentations, such as all being stratified as high-risk, but diverse outcomes.\n",
      "Fig.11B shows the detailed views of the biomedical and genomic data of the three selected patients, showing the significant difference in gene expression values of patient ALL123 in comparison with ALL26 and ALL302.\n",
      "This property may explain the differences in treatment outcome of the three patients despite the similar clinical presentation and treatment regimen.\n",
      "The interactive heatmap visualization of the expanded set of SNPs and gene expression probe sets used in the array platforms allows the analyst to examine each specific genetic attribute represented by the 250 features (Fig.11C) that further confirm the hypothesis.\n",
      "We also carried out an analysis for different groups of patients.\n",
      "The experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the similarity space.\n",
      "For example, the genetic analysis of four clusters of patients (see Fig.5) has unveiled that all probe sets of the gene MKI67 of the patients in cluster 0 (at the bottom-left and painted with a light-pink color) are significantly different from the others (see Fig.12).\n",
      "Further visualization with the probe set mapping across the patient's population has confirmed this property (see Fig.5).\n",
      "Details of the other findings (and the confirmation of the prognoses) are described further as follows.\n",
      "There is little coherence between the genomic property and the biomedical property, such as risk, dead, or survival rate.\n",
      "Similar patients in terms of background and clinical information might have significant differences in their genetic properties.\n",
      "For example, Fig.13 illustrates the details of several genes of interest for the four patients: ALL92, ALL129, ALL323, and ALL321.\n",
      "The patients' clinical properties are similar, including MR, male, deceased, and Study 8 protocol.\n",
      "However, the Affymetrix expression microarrays and Illumina SNPs values are quite varied among these patients.\n",
      "Early treatments are more effective than late treatments (see Fig.14).\n",
      "Particularly, there was only one death out of 19 cases (95% chance of survival from the disease) if the treatment was started within 5 years after birth.\n",
      "The dead case also happened to a very high-risk patient who was unlikely to survive because of the disease.\n",
      "If the treatment was started after 5 years but within 10 years from birth, the survival rate is 86% (3 deaths out of 22 cases), and if the treatment was used after 10 years from birth, the survival rate reduces significantly to 69% (4 deaths out of 13 cases).\n",
      "Among the very high-risk patients ALL123, ALL143, ALL144, and ALL302 (top-left), patient ALL302 (near bottom-right) was the only survivor whose genetic property was significantly different from the others (at the top-left).\n",
      "Further examination using the 250 GOIs illustrated in Fig.15 confirms this hypothesis for the expression values, especially for the genes ABHD10, LEPREL1, CNOT4, CHD9, EPOR, RASAL2, ZNF141, and SLC25A31.\n",
      "The variation at a particular gene or a combination of these genes might have contributed to the survival rate or an improvement in treatment.\n",
      "This finding can be verified by further analysis using larger and more comprehensive datasets and, ultimately, the actual proof of the clinical experiments.\n",
      "Patients who were born in later years have a better chance of survival.\n",
      "For example, the rate of survival for those patients born after 1995 was approximately 94% while the rate for those patients born before 1995 was approximately 83%.\n",
      "This property reflects the improvement in treatment technology, treatment methodology, and living conditions.\n",
      "Female patients tend to fare better than male patients overall (see Fig.16).\n",
      "There is a 92.5% chance of survival in females (3 dead cases out of 40) versus an 88.3% chance of survival in males (7 dead cases out of 60).\n",
      "The Study 8 protocol is dominant.\n",
      "The BFM 95 protocol is mostly applied to standard- to medium-risk patients who were born before 2000.\n",
      "The Study 8 protocol is a much more popular method, and it was used for patients regardless of risk strategies and age.\n",
      "Fig.17 shows the protocols used in ALL treatment, including Study 8 (green), BFM 95 (blue), Interfant 99 (orange), and others (red).\n",
      "Chemotherapy is more effective in treatment.\n",
      "It is interesting that nearly one-half of all patients did not have any treatments (or there were no treatment records) on record.\n",
      "The untreated patients mostly have standard to MRs.\n",
      "The bone marrow transplant treatment method has little effect on the survival rate (only 1 out of 5 cases survived).\n",

      "Target enrichment was performed using Selector technology (Halo Genomics, Uppsala, Sweden), which showed improved coverage and compatibility with next-generation sequencing library construction by employing rolling-circle amplification [10].\n",
      "This method exhibited about 97% mean coverage at 30× depth, average 42% specificity, and high reproducibility (r2 = 0.98) of target enrichment in the normal sample (Tables 1, 2, 3), indicating that this is applicable to targeted resequencing of clinical samples.\n",
      "Although the enrichment specificity was moderate, this was overcome by increasing sequencing depth.\n",
      "As the total DNA bases of the target regions was 107 kb, 97% coverage at 30× depth was achieved by 3.25 Gb of sequencing, which does not create any cost issues by using next-generation sequencing technologies.\n",

      "To solve this problem, we tried to remove previously known normal variations as much as possible.\n",
      "Predicted SNVs from the sequencing data were further filtered using common variation information from the most updated dbSNP database.\n",
      "As a result, we found many somatic mutations, which included previously reported mutations in the COSMIC database, such as variations in TP53, KRAS, and STK11 of sample H-23 and in EGFR of sample H-1650 (Table 4).\n",
      "Especially, the number of reads that covered the four variations was more than 1,000.\n",
      "This provides many advantages when compared to whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing.\n",
      "Sequencing of cancer samples has raised several issues, such as sample purity and cancer heterogeneity.\n",
      "These shortcomings can only be overcome by in-depth sequencing of target regions.\n",
      "Therefore, our protocol is also useful for cost-effective somatic mutation screening of admixed clinical cancer samples.\n",
      "Compared to whole-genome sequencing, targeted sequencing has an issue with uneven coverage of targeted genes.\n",
      "In Table 3, cancer samples showed fewer sequencing reads at target regions.\n",
      "This low target capture efficiency in cancer samples could be explained by genetic variations in cancer genomes that inhibit the hybridization between cancer DNA fragments and the designed capture oligonucleotides.\n",
      "This may be overcome by trial-and-error screening in selecting more efficient oligonucleotides.\n",
      "There are two kinds of target capture technologies: hybridization and PCR.\n",
      "Hybridization-based target capture has been widely used and is able to cover more target regions but is time-consuming and hard to handle with many samples.\n",
      "In contrast, the PCR-based method is faster and allows us to handle more samples.\n",
      "Our protocol is a multiple displacement amplification-based method that is as efficient as the PCR-based method.\n",
      "For example, hybridization-based target capture methods, such as the Agilent SureSelect target enrichment kit and NimbleGen SeqCap EZ kit, normally handle 1-8 samples at the same time, while our protocol with a liquid handler could process 96 samples in parallel.\n",
      "This costs 12 times less money.\n",
      "Therefore, our target enrichment is scalable and easy to handle with multiple samples.\n",
      "This can result in remarkable reduction of total cost when combined with multiplexed next-generation sequencing.\n",

      "Although the side effects of aspirin are not common, these effects have been reported in about 10% of adult asthmatics.\n",
      "In AERD pathogenesis, aspirin inhibits the activation of cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, leading to block of production of prostaglandin and thromboxane.\n",

      "\n",
      "Owing to the generation of vast amounts of sequencing data by using cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing technologies with improved computational approaches, many putative proteins have been discovered after assembly and structural annotation.\n",
      "Putative proteins are typically annotated using a functional annotation system that uses extant databases, but the expansive size of these databases often causes a bottleneck for rapid functional annotation.\n",
      "We developed SFannotation, a simple and fast functional annotation system that rapidly annotates putative proteins against four extant databases, Swiss-Prot, TIGRFAMs, Pfam, and the non-redundant sequence database, by using a best-hit approach with BLASTP and HMMSEARCH.\n",
      "Functional annotation of putative proteins is a fundamental and essential practice in the postgenomics era [1]; it allows us to analyze genomic and genetic features, such as physiological activity and metabolism, as well as to discover medically and industrially relevant enzymes.\n",
      "Since large numbers of putative proteins were discovered from a vast amount of sequencing data generated using high-throughput sequencing technologies, including those of the next and third generation, many automated functional annotation systems have contributed greatly to the annotation of them with minimal manual effort [2].\n",
      "However, their runtime performance of functional annotation against large extant databases often causes a bottleneck, and especially, standalone tools, such as AutoFACT [3] and BLANNOTOR [4], demand high-performance hardware resources for fast annotation from users.\n",
      "From the user's perspective, a web-based annotation server system would be a useful tool to bypass the demands of high-performance computer resources, and besides, they offer user-friendly interfaces.\n",
      "The RAST server system is particularly popular and can be used to rapidly annotate many microbial proteins against a specially curated subsystem database [5].\n",
      "Web server systems, however, may be undesirable because of critical obstacles, such as the limitation of usable server resources, a long waiting time by many queries, a low-bandwidth network or unstable traffic flow associated with the upload of query data and download of outputs, and data security problems.\n",
      "Thus, some users prefer standalone systems to web-based systems in spite of the demand for high-performance resources.\n",
      "Although standalone and web-based systems have good and bad points, slow runtime performance in themselves cannot be avoided because of the exponential increase in database sizes, without controlling some aspect of the annotation workflow.\n",
      "We developed SFannotation, which rapidly annotates putative proteins by using single or bidirectional best-hit approach with sequence-based methods-BLASTP [6] and HMMSEARCH [7]-against big extant databases: Swiss-Prot [8], TIGRFAMs [9], Pfam [10], and the non-redundant sequence database (NR) of NCBI [11].\n",
      "As best-hit approaches, especially bidirectional best-hit [12], have been widely utilized in searching reliable homologous protein sequences, such as orthologs, as well as functional annotation systems [13,14,15,16], SFannotation can reliably annotate putative proteins.\n",
      "Remarkably, SFannotation can rapidly annotate proteins against large extant databases by our hierarchical workflow.\n",
      "Before annotating putative proteins against Swiss-Prot, TIGRFAMs, Pfam, and the NR database, SFannotation filters out all proteins described in the databases by terms, such as \"unknown,\" \"hypothetical,\" \"unclassified,\" \"uncharacterized,\" \"putative,\" \"predicted,\" and \"conserved\" (Fig.1A), because some putative proteins may be misannotated by their inclusion.\n",
      "Then, using BLASTP and HMMSEARCH, SFannotation searches homologous proteins and domains in each refined database using a default threshold (≤10-5 E-value) and selects the highest-scoring homolog to annotate putative proteins as the best-hit approach, such as single best hit and bidirectional best hit [12, 16].\n",
      "Putative proteins are hierarchically annotated using the following database priority: Swiss-Prot → TIGRFAMs → Pfam → NR, which is ordered according to their reliability (Fig.1B).\n",
      "Once annotated, the putative proteins are no longer queried using homology searches against the other databases.\n",
      "For example, if a putative protein is annotated against Swiss-Prot, it is excluded from annotation against the other databases, while the remaining unannotated putative proteins continue to be annotated against the other databases.\n",
      "Therefore, the runtime performance can be reduced, because the number of unannotated putative proteins gradually decreases (Fig.2).\n",

      "This Peg3 domain shares several features with the other imprinted domains, including an evolutionarily conserved domain structure, along with transcriptional co-regulation through shared cis regulatory elements, as well as functional roles in controlling fetal growth rates and maternal-caring behaviors.\n",
      "The Peg3 domain also displays some unique features, including YY1-mediated regulation of transcription and imprinting; conversion and adaptation of several protein-coding members as ncRNA genes during evolution; and its close connection to human cancers through the potential tumor suppressor functions of Peg3 and Usp29.\n",
      "In this review, we summarize and discuss these features of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "In mammals, a small subset of autosomal genes are functionally different between two alleles due to an epigenetic mechanism, termed genomic imprinting [1, 2].\n",
      "The number of imprinted genes is estimated to be 100-200 per mammalian genome.\n",
      "These genes are usually clustered in specific chromosomal regions; thus, several genes from a given genomic interval are imprinted together as a group.\n",
      "Each imprinted domain, harboring 5 to 10 members, spans a relatively large genomic interval, ranging from a few hundred kilobases to megabases in length [3].\n",
      "The genomic structure of a given domain, such as gene content, order, and distance, is well conserved between different mammalian lineages.\n",
      "The evolutionary constraint maintaining this domain structure is likely related to the fact that the imprinted genes within one domain are usually co-regulated through shared cis regulatory elements.\n",
      "These regulatory regions are termed imprinting control regions (ICRs) [4].\n",
      "Several ICRs have been identified from individual domains by a series of human and mouse genetic studies in the past 20 years.\n",
      "Genetic and molecular studies investigating these ICRs, particularly the ICR of the H19/Igf2 domain, have been very insightful with regard to our understanding of epigenetics, as well as long-distance transcriptional control mechanisms in humans and mice [2].\n",
      "Paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3) is one of the imprinted genes that were discovered 20 years ago through subtractive pooling schemes of mRNA between paternal and maternal disomic embryos [5].\n",
      "An independent study also discovered Peg3 as an important gene for muscle development; it was thus named Pw1 [6].\n",
      "Shortly after these simultaneous discoveries of mouse Peg3, the human homolog was also identified as one of the zinc finger genes located in human chromosome 19q13.4 [7].\n",
      "Since then, six additional imprinted genes have been identified from the 500-kb genomic interval surrounding the Peg3 locus, confirming the presence of an imprinted domain in the human and mouse genomes; it was thus named the Peg3 imprinted domain.\n",
      "A series of follow-up investigations have been conducted to characterize the genomic structures and regulatory mechanisms, as well as the functions of individual genes located within the Peg3 imprinted domain.\n",
      "In this short review, we intend to 1) summarize the information that we have learned so far regarding the Peg3 domain and 2) discuss the similarities and differences between the Peg3 domain and other imprinted domains.\n",
      "The 500-kb genomic interval of the Peg3 domain harbors seven imprinted genes: paternally expressed Peg3; Usp29 (ubiquitin-specific hydrolase 29); APeg3 (antisense Peg3); Zfp264 (zinc finger protein 264); and maternally expressed Zim1 (zinc finger gene, imprinted 1), Zim2, and Zim3 (Fig.1) [8,9,10,11,12].\n",
      "All of these imprinted genes, except Zim1, are conserved among individual mammalian species.\n",
      "Zim1, however, is found only in mammals with large litter sizes, such as rodents and canines [13].\n",
      "The order, spacing, and orientation of these imprinted genes are also well conserved between different mammalian species.\n",
      "This is quite unusual, since the Peg3 domain itself is part of a large zinc finger gene family cluster, which is known to go through dynamic genomic changes during evolution.\n",
      "This is even more evident in the genomic regions immediately surrounding the Peg3 domain, which are occupied by two gene families: olfactory receptor and vomeronasal organ receptor.\n",
      "These two gene families show many more frequent lineage-specific expansions and deletions during mammalian evolution, resulting in quite different structures between different species [14].\n",
      "The changes observed from the surrounding genomic regions are in stark contrast to the structural conservation observed in the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "Within the 500-kb region of the Peg3 domain, the seven imprinted genes are unevenly distributed: three genes are clustered together on one side, and the remaining four genes are on the other side (Fig.1).\n",
      "By contrast, the middle 250-kb region is more or less empty, lacking any obvious open reading frame (ORF).\n",
      "Yet, this overall genomic layout is well conserved among all mammals [8].\n",
      "According to the results from a sequence comparison of several mammalian species, this middle 250-kb region is filled with 20 small genomic fragments, ranging from 100-300 bp in length, that show high levels of sequence conservation between species.\n",
      "These regions, termed evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs), are likely cis regulatory elements that may be involved in controlling the transcription and imprinting of the Peg3 domain [15].\n",
      "This prediction has been recently confirmed through the epigenomic results in which the majority of these ECRs is associated with two histone modifications, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (monomethylation of lysine 4 and acetylation of lysine 27, respectively, of histone 3) [16], which are closely associated with enhancers [17].\n",
      "The relative positions, spacing, and orientations of these potential cis regulatory elements are also well conserved among all mammals.\n",
      "This large number of potential cis regulatory elements within the 250-kb region hints at one possibility that unknown, but complex, regulatory mechanisms exist to control transcription and imprinting of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "Although the 500-kb domain has been structurally well preserved during mammalian evolution, the protein-coding capacity of each imprinted gene has been quite often lost independently in the different lineages of mammals (Fig.1).\n",
      "For example, three zinc finger genes, Zim2, Zim3, and Zfp264, all have lost their ORFs in the rodent lineage [9, 10].\n",
      "The current sequences of these genes in rodents have diverged substantially from their original coding sequences, so that they are barely recognizable as zinc finger genes.\n",
      "Thus, these genes may have lost their ORFs quite a long time ago, at the early stages of rodent evolution.\n",
      "Nevertheless, they are still transcriptionally active, indicating that these genes might have functionally adapted as non-coding RNA genes.\n",
      "In fact, one of these genes, Zim3, has become an antisense gene to Usp29: the transcribed regions overlap quite extensively between maternally expressed Zim3 and paternally expressed Usp29.\n",
      "Usp29 also has taken a similar evolutionary path as seen in the three zinc finger genes.\n",
      "In the bovine lineage, the overall sequence structure of Usp29 is still intact, without any major deletions and insertions, but it contains several base substitutions causing STOP codons, indicating that these substitutions likely occurred in recent evolutionary times in the bovine lineage [13].\n",
      "Interestingly, a similar situation has also been observed in one human population: one substitution causing a STOP codon has been found within the coding region of USP29 (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html).\n",
      "So far, Peg3 is the only gene that has maintained its ORF in all lineages of mammals, while the other imprinted genes have lost ORFs in the different lineages of mammals.\n",
      "This suggests that the functions of Peg3 might be the most critical for the survival of mammals as a protein-coding gene.\n",
      "On the other hand, the other members of the Peg3 domain might be less critical for the survival of mammals, which subsequently allows them to have adapted as ncRNA genes during mammalian evolution.\n",
      "The transcription of the Peg3 domain is regulated through at least five promoters: two bidirectional promoters for Peg3/Usp29 and Zim3/Zfp264 and three individual promoters for APeg3, Zim1, and Zim2.\n",
      "Among these promoter regions, three regions are differentially methylated between two alleles; thus they are named differentially methylated regions (DMRs).\n",
      "These include the DMRs of Peg3, Zim2, and Zim3 (Fig.1).\n",
      "According to previous studies, the PEG3-DMR is a gametic DMR, such that its allele-specific methylation is established during gametogenesis in parents-in this case, the maternal-specific methylation during oogenesis [18].\n",
      "In contrast, the DMRs of Zim2 and Zim3 are established after fertilization and are thus categorized as somatic DMRs [19].\n",
      "The promoter of Zim1, on the other hand, is not methylated at all on either allele, whereas the methylation status of the APeg3 promoter is currently unknown.\n",
      "Among the three DMRs, the Peg3-DMR is the most critical for transcription and imprinting of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "Deletion of part of this DMR causes changes in the transcriptional levels of all genes in this domain [20].\n",
      "The same mutation also affects the monoallelic expression (imprinting) pattern of two genes, Zfp264 and Zim2: a switch from paternal- to maternal-specific expression for Zfp264 and a change from maternal to biallelic expression for Zim2.\n",
      "These results demonstrate that the Peg3-DMR is an ICR for this domain.\n",
      "It is, however, currently unknown how the Peg3-DMR obtains DNA methylation during oogenesis and how the Peg3-DMR serves as a major cis regulatory region governing the overall transcription of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "The 4.0-kb Peg3-DMR can be divided into two small regions: the first 1.5-kb region harbors the bidirectional promoter and the first exon for both Peg3 and Usp29, and the second 2.5-kb region covers the first intron of Peg3.\n",
      "The 2.5-kb intron region displays an unusual tandem repeat sequence structure, and one small motif (GGCGCCATCTT) within these repeats turns out to be a DNA-binding site for the transcription factor YY1 [21, 22].\n",
      "Since this YY1-binding motif is part of the tandem repeats, multiple YY1 binding sites, 10 sites on average, are easily found within the 2.5-kb region of the Peg3-DMR for any given mammal [23].\n",
      "A series of studies have been conducted to understand the potential roles for YY1 in the function of the Peg3-DMR.\n",
      "First, according to the results, conditional knockdown of YY1 during oogenesis results in hypomethylation of the Peg3-DMR, suggesting that the protein level of YY1 is very critical for the establishment of DNA methylation in the Peg3-DMR [24].\n",
      "A similar outcome has also been observed in somatic cells using in vivo and in vitro systems [25, 26].\n",
      "Thus, YY1 is likely to be involved in setting DNA methylation and also in the maintenance of the Peg3-DMR.\n",
      "Second, the expression of Peg3 is usually up-regulated in response to the reduced levels of YY1 protein.\n",
      "This suggests that YY1 may function as a repressor of the transcription of Peg3 in somatic cells.\n",
      "This outcome is usually accompanied by global changes in the expression levels of other imprinted genes in the Peg3 domain, confirming a major role played by YY1 in the entire Peg3 domain [26].\n",
      "Collectively, the results obtained so far confirm that YY1 is a major regulator of the Peg3 domain, possibly through the Peg3-DMR.\n",
      "Along with the five promoters, the 20 ECRs located in the middle 250-kb region are also predicted to be involved in the transcriptional control of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "To further follow up on this prediction, a series of 3C (chromosome conformation capture) experiments were conducted using various adult tissues harvested from mouse [15].\n",
      "The results revealed that one of these ECRs interacts with the bidirectional promoter of Peg3/Usp29.\n",
      "This particular one, ECR18, is located 200 kb upstream of the bidirectional promoter, which is actually positioned closer to the bidirectional promoter of Zim3/Zfp264.\n",
      "The interaction is the most prominent in the brain but is also detected in other tissues, such as testis and liver.\n",
      "As described earlier, ECR18 is associated with two histone modifications, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, which mark active enhancers.\n",
      "Subsequent in vitro promoter assays indeed demonstrated that ECR18 functions as an enhancer for the promoter of Peg3/Usp29 in several cell lines tested.\n",
      "The 3C experiments further indicated that ECR18 also interacts with the other promoters of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "In particular, the bidirectional promoter of Zim3/Zfp264 and the promoter of Zim2 were shown to interact with ECR18 in the testis.\n",
      "Thus, ECR18 might be a shared enhancer for several genes in the Peg3 domain, not just for Peg3 and Usp29.\n",
      "The transcription and imprinting of the Peg3 domain is likely to be co-regulated through the Peg3-DMR, given the observations described above, such as global changes in the expression levels of the Peg3 domain either by targeting of the Peg3-DMR or by targeting of the transcription factor YY1.\n",
      "This predicted mechanism might be explained in the following manner, which involves ECR18 as a shared enhancer for the Peg3 domain (Fig.2).\n",
      "On the paternal allele, the Peg3-DMR is unmethylated, and functions as a dominant promoter for both Peg3 and Usp29, thus outcompeting the promoters of the remaining genes, Zim1 and Zim2, for usage of the shared enhancer ECR18.\n",
      "On the maternal allele, the Peg3-DMR is methylated and silent, so that the promoters of Zim1 and Zim2 can access ECR18 for their transcription.\n",
      "This results in the paternal expression of Peg3 and Usp29 and the maternal expression of Zim1 and Zim2.\n",
      "This is particularly true in the brain, as strict imprinting and transcription of these four genes are usually observed in the neonatal brain.\n",
      "On the other hand, the imprinting and transcription of the remaining genes are either bi-allelic or not detectable in the brain; thus, the proposed model is more applicable for explaining the imprinting of the four genes in the brain.\n",
      "This model could explain some of the effects observed from the deletion mutant of the Peg3-DMR, showing bi-allelic expression of Zim2 in carriers inheriting the mutation paternally [20].\n",
      "Deletion of part of the Peg3-DMR, the 2.5-kb YY1-binding sites, is likely to be responsible for the down-regulation of Peg3 expression and subsequently allows the access of Zim2 to the shared enhancer ECR18 on the paternal allele, resulting in the bi-allelic expression of Zim2.\n",
      "Although reasonable, this model needs to be revised with additional data in the near future in order to explain many aspects of the imprinting and transcription of the Peg3 domain that cannot be explained at the moment.\n",
      "At the organismal level, mammalian imprinted genes usually have similar functions, controlling fetal growth rates and nurturing behaviors [27, 28].\n",
      "This is likely the case for the imprinted genes located within the Peg3 domain, based on the following lines of evidence.\n",
      "First, most genes in the Peg3 domain are expressed in early embryogenesis and the brain.\n",
      "The expression levels of Peg3 and Zim1 are very high in embryos and placenta [5, 11].\n",
      "In brain, Peg3, Zim1, Zim2, and APeg3 are all expressed in the hypothalamus [29, 30], which is known to be involved in controlling maternal-caring behaviors and milk provision [31].\n",
      "Second, mutations in the Peg3 locus tend to have two consistent phenotypic effects [29, 32].\n",
      "The pups with mutant alleles have defects in milk-suckling behaviors.\n",
      "As a consequence, the carriers become progressively weaker than their littermates due to the insufficient uptake of milk, which quite often results in perinatal lethality.\n",
      "The adult mice of both genders also have various reproductive and behavioral problems [32,33,34].\n",
      "Mutant females produce a relatively small number of mature eggs, resulting in reduced litter sizes.\n",
      "Also, pregnant females have problems in milk letdown and in maternal-caring behaviors, thus causing the perinatal lethality observed among wild-type pups.\n",
      "It is interesting to point out that Peg3 mutations have effects on a set of paired behaviors between the mothers and their pups for milk provision, milk suckling, and letdown.\n",
      "This has been a basis for the 'co-adaptation' theory of mammalian genomic imprinting [35].\n",
      "In the case of bovine Usp29, a mutation deleting a 100-kb interval within the middle 250-kb region has been shown to be responsible for the stillbirth of calves [36].\n",
      "The exact mechanism by which this deletion causes stillbirth is currently unknown, but this mutational effect is overall consistent with the phenotypes that have been observed from the Peg3 domain, controlling the growth and development of the fetus during the gestational period.\n",
      "At the cellular level, the predicted functions of Peg3 are worthwhile to be discussed.\n",
      "Peg3 is a potential tumor suppressor, given the observation that many human patients with ovarian and breast cancers lose the expression of PEG3 due to DNA hypermethylation on the PEG3-DMR [37,38,39].\n",
      "This was further demonstrated by in vitro studies in which reintroduction of human PEG3 into primary cell lines derived from ovarian cancer patients resulted in the inhibition of cell growth [39].\n",
      "According to recent data from in vitro studies, Peg3 also appears to be involved in autophagy in endothelial cells [40].\n",
      "Soluble forms of several structural proteins, including decorin, are shown to trigger autophagy in endothelial cells as part of the apoptotic pathways that are designed to remove stressed and damaged cells.\n",
      "Interestingly, PEG3 has been found to play a major role in conveying this external signal through vesicular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) to induce the transcription of two core components, BECLIN1 and LC3, for autophagosomes.\n",
      "The potential roles of Peg3 in autophagy are particularly intriguing, since Peg3 is predicted to play important roles in the placenta, where autophagy is critical for the constant turnover of protein and other nutritional materials [41].\n",
      "It is also relevant to note that nutritional starvation of pregnant females causes changes in the expression levels of a subset of mammalian genes.\n",
      "Interestingly, the majority of these genes is also affected by mutations on Peg3, suggesting that these genes are likely either direct or indirect downstream genes of Peg3 [41].\n",
      "Thus, Peg3 may be a major player in controlling in nutritional supply between females and pups during pregnancy.\n",
      "Since autophagy is regarded as a part of apoptotic pathways, the potential roles for Peg3 in autophagy are also consistent with previous observations hinting at the functions of Peg3 in apoptosis.\n",
      "These include up-regulation of Peg3 during p53-mediated apoptosis, muscle cachexia (or wasting) in response to tumor load, and induction of Peg3 in response to hypoxic conditions [42,43,44].\n",
      "Taken together, these results support the idea that Peg3 is a tumor suppressor with a potential connection to autophagy.\n",
      "At the molecular level, the imprinted genes in the Peg3 domain code for two different types of proteins: a ubiquitin-specific protease for Usp29 and zinc finger proteins for Peg3, Zim1, Zim2, Zim3, and Zfp264.\n",
      "According to recent studies, USP29 might also be a tumor suppressor, given the observation that USP29 is required for the stability of Claspin, a key protein for the DNA damage checkpoint [45].\n",
      "This is quite intriguing, since DNA hypermethylation of the PEG3-DMR has always been regarded as an epigenetic abnormality affecting the expression of PEG3 but not USP29, although the PEG3-DMR controls both genes.\n",
      "Thus, it would be interesting to test whether the outcome of this DNA hypermethylation manifests as down-regulation of PEG3 only or PEG3 and USP29 together.\n",
      "Among the four zinc finger proteins within the Peg3 domain, Peg3 is the only gene that has been studied so far at the protein level.\n",
      "According to recent studies, PEG3 binds to many genomic loci as a DNA-binding protein with transcriptional repression activity [46].\n",
      "It is well known that many zinc finger proteins, including those in the Peg3 domain, repress their downstream genes through interaction with KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP-1) and SET domain-containing histone methylase at H3K9 (SETDB1) [47, 48].\n",
      "Thus, we predict that PEG3 may also repress its downstream genes through SETDB1/KAP-1-driven H3K9me3.\n",
      "According to recent studies, several placenta-specific gene families are de-repressed in mouse embryos with the Peg3-null mutant allele; yet, these gene families are usually repressed through H3K9me3-mediated mechanisms [49, 50].\n",
      "Thus, this result again supports the idea that PEG3 controls its downstream genes through H3K9me3-mediated mechanisms.\n",
      "At the molecular level, several genes within the Peg3 domain are also predicted to function as ncRNA genes (Fig.1).\n",
      "Among these genes, APeg3 is quite unique as an RNA gene due to the following reasons.\n",
      "First, it is well conserved among all mammals [51].\n",
      "Second, it is an antisense transcript gene localized in the 3'-UTR of another proteincoding gene-in this case, Peg3 [12].\n",
      "Third, APeg3 is expressed only in the hypothalamus but highly up-regulated in response to osmotic challenge [30].\n",
      "Given these special circumstances, it has been predicted that APeg3 may be designed to control the expression of Peg3.\n",
      "Consistent with this prediction, in vitro studies demonstrated that APeg3 has the potential to down-regulate the mRNA and protein levels of Peg3 [51].\n",
      "Although the mechanistic basis for the observed down-regulation needs to be investigated further, the in vivo functions of APeg3 are most likely connected to those of Peg3.\n",
      "The Peg3 domain displays unique features and also shares several features with the other imprinted domains.\n",
      "First, the domain structure has been well preserved during mammalian evolution, as seen in the other domains.\n",
      "This makes sense with the prediction that the imprinting and transcription of the Peg3 domain are likely controlled, as a group, through a shared cis regulatory element-in this case, the Peg3-DMR.\n",
      "As part of the conserved genomic interval, many ECRs are found to be localized within the middle 250-kb region and are also predicted to be enhancers for individual imprinted genes within the Peg3 domain (Fig.1).\n",
      "Coordinating these potential enhancers with individual promoters may be needed, since some of these ECRs are likely to be shared among individual imprinted genes.\n",
      "As an ICR, the Peg3-DMR might be responsible for this coordinating task.\n",
      "According to a situation observed in the H19/Igf2-imprinted domain, its ICR functions as an enhancer blocker through another transcription factor, CTCF, controlling the accessibility of a shared enhancer between H19 and Igf2 [1, 2].\n",
      "Interestingly, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 domain also has an unusual cluster of CTCF binding sites, which is very similar to the localization of a tandem array of multiple YY1 binding sites within the Peg3-DMR [52].\n",
      "Although both ICRs are similar in many ways, their roles as ICRs are likely different from each other.\n",
      "This prediction is based on the result that YY1 and YY1 binding sites do not display enhancer-blocking activity [53].\n",
      "One plausible role for YY1 might be 'linking' or 'tethering' long-distance enhancers to the corresponding target promoters [54].\n",
      "As described earlier, ECR18 interacts with the bidirectional promoter of Peg3/Usp29.\n",
      "This long-distance interaction, or linking, between ECR18 and the bidirectional promoter may be mediated through the YY1/YY1-binding sites within the Peg3-DMR (Fig.2).\n",
      "A similar scenario is also possible for the other ECRs found within the Peg3 domain, which warrants a series of systematic and careful investigations in the near future.\n",
      "Overall, as seen in other domains, the conserved genomic structure of the Peg3 domain makes sense with the presence of co-regulation through the Peg3-DMR, but the mechanisms governing the Peg3 domain by this ICR are likely to be unique, based on the involvement of the transcription factor YY1.\n",
      "Second, the overall functional outcomes of the Peg3 domain are similar to those observed from other domains, such as controlling fetal growth rates and maternal-caring behaviors [27, 28, 35].\n",
      "In particular, this has been consistently demonstrated through functional studies of the Peg3 locus [29, 32].\n",
      "Despite these similar outcomes at the organismal level, the potential function of each imprinted gene is likely to be unique at the molecular and cellular levels.\n",
      "For instance, Peg3 codes for a DNA-binding protein with repression activity at the molecular level and inhibits cell growth as a tumor suppressor at the cellular level.\n",
      "Yet, Peg3 is regarded as a growth stimulator at the organismal level, since the down-regulation of Peg3 usually results in reduction in body size.\n",
      "The functional outcomes of Peg3 seem to be somewhat contradictory between the cellular and organismal levels.\n",
      "This is quite unique compared to other imprinted genes encoding proteins with different biochemical properties, such as paternally expressed insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) and maternally expressed insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (Igf2r).\n",
      "The phenotypic outcomes of this pair of ligand and receptor are overall similar at the cellular and organismal levels [27, 28].\n",
      "Igf2 stimulates cell growth, and thus, higher levels of Igf2 result in bigger body size.\n",
      "Igf2r derives exactly the opposite phenotypes to those of Igf2, inhibiting cell growth, and thus, more Igf2r results in smaller body size.\n",
      "As proposed earlier, the conflicting phenotypes of Peg3 at the cellular and organismal levels could be explained in the following manner [55].\n",
      "Peg3 might be involved in programmed cell death during the development of neuron cells-specifically, a set of neuron cells producing growth suppressors.\n",
      "The absence of Peg3 could result in the overgrowth of these neuron cells with an excessive amount of growth suppressors at the cellular level, causing smaller body size at the organismal level.\n",
      "Although this remains to be tested, it is feasible, since many imprinted genes are highly expressed in the neuroendocrine system, such as the hypothalamus, which is responsible for controlling body size through growth hormones [31].\n",
      "In that regard, it is interesting to note that another paternally expressed DNA-binding gene, Zac1 (zinc finger protein regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest), also shows similar conflicting outcomes-it is a growth suppressor at the cellular level but a growth stimulator at the organismal level [56, 57].\n",
      "Since both Peg3 and Zac1 are growth suppressors at the cellular level, these genes have been quite often identified as tumor suppressors.\n",
      "Although the overall functional contributions by the Peg3 domain are similar to those of other domains at the organismal level, the detailed function of each imprinted gene is predicted to be unique at the cellular and molecular levels.\n",
      "Third, the Peg3 domain also contains several ncRNA genes, as seen in other imprinted domains.\n",
      "These ncRNA genes include Zim2, Zim3, and Zfp264 in the rodent lineage (Fig.1).\n",
      "These ncRNA genes are unique due to the following reasons.\n",
      "First, these ncRNA genes are of relatively recent evolutionary origin, so that their ancestral genes can be identified easily through sequence similarity to their corresponding protein-coding sequences.\n",
      "It is currently unknown whether these ncRNA genes are in the process of becoming pseudogenes or have already adapted as ncRNA genes with some functions.\n",
      "Regardless, they have maintained their transcriptional activity for quite a long time, given the accumulation of mutations disrupting their ORFs, suggesting that their gene products, ncRNA, or transcription itself is now part of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "If some of them have already adapted as ncRNA genes, examining their sequences should provide some clues regarding how protein-coding sequences become ncRNA genes during evolution.\n",
      "Thus, the ncRNA genes of the Peg3 domain might provide a very unique opportunity to understand the evolutionary paths of mammalian genes.\n",
      "In that regard, it is relevant to note that mammalian X chromosome inactivation-specific transcript (Xist) represents another well-known case where a proteincoding gene has become an ncRNA gene [58].\n",
      "Second, some functions of these ncRNA genes should be lineage-specific to rodents, since the original genes of these ncRNA genes are still protein-coding genes in all other mammals.\n",
      "This level of lineage-specific change has not been observed from other imprinted domains.\n",
      "This might be related to the fact that the Peg3 domain has been part of a large zinc finger gene family, which is known to be vulnerable to genomic rearrangements, including deletion and duplication [14].\n",
      "Also, the functional redundancy afforded by the zinc finger gene family might have allowed its members to drift away from their proteincoding sequences without severe phenotypic consequences.\n",
      "Overall, the structurally conserved genomic interval of the Peg3 domain might have allowed several protein-coding members to adapt into ncRNA genes, which seems to be quite different from the evolutionary patterns observed from other imprinted domains.\n",
      "The Peg3 domain shows many similar features as seen in other imprinted domains, which include its conserved genomic structure, allowing long-distance transcriptional regulation through ICRs, as well as allele-specific DNA methylation and subsequent monoallelic expression.\n",
      "In the past two decades, these unusual features have been studied extensively using other imprinted domains as model loci.\n",
      "At the same time, the Peg3 domain displays several unique features that have not been studied in other imprinted domains.\n",
      "These unique features are thus worthwhile to study in the future in increase our understanding of genomic imprinting and imprinting-related human disorders.\n",
      "First, YY1/YY1-binding sites appear to be a major player in the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "In particular, a tandem array of YY1-binding sites has been selected for the function of the Peg3-DMR; yet, the molecular basis for this function is still unknown.\n",
      "One possibility would be that these multiple YY1-binding sites might be involved in setting DNA methylation during oogenesis.\n",
      "The other possibility would be that these YY1-binding sites might be required for the transcriptional control of Peg3 and adjacent imprinted genes.\n",
      "Targeting these YY1-binding sites through mutagenesis experiments should provide a clear and direct answer regarding the in vivo role of multiple YY1-binding sites.\n",
      "Second, Peg3 has been recognized as a potential tumor suppressor for some time, without any progress in our understanding.\n",
      "According to recent studies, Peg3 may play a major role in regulating autophagy of endothelial cells, which is very intriguing, due to the following reasons: 1) Peg3 is highly expressed in the organs that are regarded as endothelial cell-rich tissues, such as placenta, and 2) autophagy is also regarded as part of apoptotic pathways.\n",
      "Thus, characterizing the potential roles of Peg3 in autophagy should be a worthy project in the immediate future.\n",
      "Third, the Peg3 domain appears to have evolved very rapidly during mammalian evolution.\n",
      "As a consequence, several members of this 500-kb domain have changed from protein-coding to ncRNA genes.\n",
      "It is well known that the ancestral state of a given genomic interval cannot be easily reconstructed, due to the many changes that have accumulated during long evolutionary times.\n",
      "In the case of the Peg3 domain, its 500-kb genomic structure has been so well preserved that its ancestral structure can be readily reconstructed by comparing the Peg3 domains of several mammals.\n",
      "Thus, careful sequence analyses should provide immediate insights regarding the evolutionary paths of mammalian genes, especially those that have undergone the transformation from protein-coding to non-coding RNA genes.\n",
      "Overall, these directions are worthwhile to pursue in the near future, which should most likely provide additional exciting information regarding how the Peg3 domain is regulated and what functional roles the Peg3 domain plays in mammalian biology.\n",
      "Evolutionary conservation of the Peg3 imprinted domain.\n",
      "The 500-kb genomic interval of the Peg3 domain is shown using the mouse genomic region as a representative locus, along with its relative position in mouse chromosome 7 (Mmu7).\n",
      "The paternally expressed and maternally expressed genes are indicated with blue and red arrows, respectively.\n",
      "The three differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are indicated with grey boxes.\n",
      "The 20 evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) are shown with vertical blue lines, except ECR18 in red.\n",

      "The table below summarizes the evolutionary conservation of gene content and their open reading frames (ORFs) with different colors: black for conserved and green for non-conserved.\n",
      "The first two exons of mouse Usp29 were previously named ossification center-associated transcript (Ocat), while those in humans and cow are named MER1 repeat-containing imprinted transcript 1 (MIMT1).\n",
      "aThe ORF indicates the loss of the USP29 ORF in one human population.\n",
      "Transcription and imprinting control of the Peg3 domain.\n",
      "The schematic representation illustrates a potential mode of the Peg3-DMR and ECR18 in the co-regulation and mono-allelic expression (imprinting) of four genes in the mouse brain: the paternally expressed Peg3 and Usp29 and the maternally expressed Zim1 and Zim2.\n",
      "On the paternal allele, the Peg3-DMR becomes a dominant user for the shared enhancer ECR18 and out-competes the remaining two genes, Zim1 and Zim2.\n",
      "Thus, Peg3 and Usp29 are expressed from the paternal allele, while Zim1 and Zim2 become silent on the paternal allele.\n",

      "Bone mineral density (BMD) is one of the quantitative traits that are genetically inherited and affected by various factors.\n",
      "Over the past years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have searched for many genetic loci that influence BMD.\n",
      "A recent meta-analysis of 17 GWASs for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine is the largest GWAS for BMD to date and offers 64 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 56 associated loci.\n",
      "We investigated these BMD loci in a Korean population called Korea Association REsource (KARE) to identify their validity in an independent study.\n",
      "The KARE population contains genotypes from 8,842 individuals, and their BMD levels were measured at the distal radius (BMD-RT) and midshaft tibia (BMD-TT).\n",
      "Thirteen genomic loci among 56 loci were significantly associated with BMD variations, and 3 loci were involved in known biological pathways related to BMD.\n",
      "In order to find putative functional variants, nearby SNPs in relation to linkage equilibrium were annotated, and their possible functional effects were predicted.\n",
      "These findings reveal that tens of variants, not a single factor, may contribute to the genetic architecture of BMD; have an important role regardless of ethnic group; and may highlight the importance of a replication study in GWASs to validate genuine loci for BMD variation.\n",
      "In an aging society, osteoporosis is a major health problem.\n",
      "It is characterized by systemic impairment of bone mass, strength, and microarchitecture, leading to increased risk of fragility fractures, particularly hip fracture [1].\n",
      "In the United States, the cost of incident fractures due to osteoporosis and low bone mass was $17 billion in 2006.\n",
      "It is expected to rise to around $25.3 billion by the year 2025 [2].\n",
      "Likewise, the burden for them is prevalent in Asia.\n",

      "Osteoporosis is defined by the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), which is so far the best single predictor [4, 5].\n",
      "BMD is a genetic component, with estimates of heritability ranging from 0.46 to 0.84 at all skeletal sites [6].\n",

      "These studies provide key insights into the variation of quantitative traits and prospects for designing specifically effective strategies for diseases [8].\n",
      "There have been many GWASs to identify genetic loci that influence BMD, and dozens of candidates have been presented [9,10,11,12,13].\n",
      "However, only several loci have been consistently identified in a few replication studies [14,15,16], suggesting that BMD is a complex trait affected by multiple components [17].\n",
      "Recently, a meta-analysis of 17 studies for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine was performed for the first time in order to identify consensus BMD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout races [18].\n",
      "It included 32,951 individuals across North America, Europe, East Asia, and Australia.\n",
      "The meta-analysis offered 56 associated loci that were highly significant in both the discovery stage and replication stage.\n",
      "This also proposed a model of BMD loci and successfully validated it with an independent population.\n",
      "Here, we investigate those 56 BMD loci in a Korean population called Korea Association REsource (KARE) [19].\n",
      "The analysis showed that BMD variation is a polygenic and complex trait, and it could be even different, depending on sex and the skeletal site.\n",

      "The mean T-score of the radius and tibia of the 8,586 subjects was 0.038 ± 0.016 (SEM) and -0.472 ± 0.017, respectively.\n",
      "The meta-analysis of 17 GWASs identified 64 SNPs in 56 loci associated with BMD with genomewide significance.\n",
      "The analysis also proposed a model of BMD-decreasing alleles, and their effects were validated with an independent population: a prospective study in postmenopausal Danish women aged 55-86 years.\n",
      "The alleles were scored with weights based on their individual effects on BMD.\n",
      "Even though the previous GWAS was based on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, we assumed that the effects of BMD loci would be available to BMD at other sites, such as the distal radius and midshaft tibia.\n",
      "Thus, the model was applied to the KARE population to prove its validity.\n",
      "Among 64 SNPs, 9 SNPs were genotyped in the chip, but 55 other SNPs were imputed from genotypes in the 1000 Genomes (1KG) Project (Phase I).\n",
      "After filtering, 60 SNPs were used for the analysis, and individuals were scored according to the scoring system of the previous study.\n",

      "The analysis on the basis of 60 SNPs explained 3.2% of the total genetic variance in BMD-TT.\n",
      "In order to identify variants significantly influential in the Korean population, an association analysis of 60 SNPs was done with KARE data.\n",
      "Single-marker tests of association with BMD were carried out by trend test (1 d.f.)\n",

      "Twelve SNPs showed a directionally consistent association with the previous GWAS (p < 0.05).\n",
      "Six loci were associated with BMD-RT and six loci were associated with BMD-TT, but there were no loci associated with both.\n",
      "One of these loci is on the X chromosome.\n",
      "The same analysis was carried out by gender strarification (Table 2).\n",
      "Three loci were prioritized in the female sample set, and one of them (rs13204965) was newly found in the analysis.\n",
      "Therefore, a total of 13 independent SNPs were selected for further analysis (Fig.2).\n",
      "As mentioned in the previous GWAS, some of these 13 SNPs were seen as members of biological pathways related to BMD: the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (TNFRSF11B), mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (SP7), and Wnt signaling (WNT4).\n",
      "Interestingly, SNPs in TNFRSF11B and SP7 were associated with BMD-RT, whereas the SNP in WNT4 was associated with BMD-TT (Tables 1 and 2).\n",
      "For the purpose of identifying putative functional SNPs, markers in the surrounding 100-Kb region were examined using LD (Table 3).\n",
      "Likewise, they were imputed from 1KG Phase I, centered on 13 loci.\n",
      "Eight BMD-associated SNPs were highly correlated (r2 > 0.8) with functional SNPs annotated in the 1KG reference.\n",
      "rs13245690 was related to 5 putative functional variants, which correlated with each other by LD (r2 > 0.8).\n",
      "Two SNPs (rs1524498 and rs41281692) were located within coding regions in CPED1.\n",
      "rs1524498 leads to synonymous coding, but rs41281692 leads to a conservative change of an amino acid.\n",
      "The remaining 3 SNPs (rs10228519, rs10274486, and rs1357756) were located in the intronic regions in CPED1 and are predicted to alter alleles in transcription factor binding sites.\n",
      "Each allele was anticipated to affect the binding of CUTL1, POU2F1, and GATA-1, respectively.\n",
      "rs2016266 in SP7 was correlated with two SNPs (rs1318648 and rs17125266) in ESPL1.\n",

      "rs17125266 was predicted to be conservative, but rs1318648 was predicted to be deleterious.\n",
      "rs2062377 was related to a conservative missense variant in TNFRSF11B.\n",
      "On the contrary, rs12821008 was related to the sense variant.\n",
      "Two other SNPs were associated with the 3' untranslated region: rs1346004 in GALNT3 and rs163879 in DCDC5 probably affect splicing regulation.\n",
      "In addition, rs7932354 was predicted to be related to a splice site variant in F2.\n",
      "In this report, we identified that the model proposed in a previous GWAS [18] is available to the Korean population.\n",
      "Furthermore, we found 13 genomic loci significantly associated with BMD variations in the population.\n",
      "Our results reveal that dozens of variants with small effects may contribute to the genetic architecture of BMD and have important roles, regardless of ethnic groups.\n",
      "Our study supports the important role of several biological pathways related to BMD.\n",
      "The Wnt factor (WNT4) has been known to be associated with BMD in many studies [30,31,32].\n",
      "A pathway involved in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (SP7) was also previously known [33, 34].\n",
      "The RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (TNFRSF11B) is another pathway influencing BMD [35,36,37].\n",
      "Interestingly, SNPs in TNFRSF11B and SP7 were associated with BMD-RT, whereas an SNP in WNT4 was associated with BMD-TT.\n",
      "It may suggest differential genetic influences between skeletal sites.\n",
      "In line with this phenomenon, our results reveal that there is sex- and site-specificity underlying BMD variation.\n",
      "rs13204965 was only significant in women and showed significant sex heterogeneity.\n",
      "Also, in the same manner, the variant was only associated with females in a previous GWAS [18].\n",
      "In a recent GWAS focusing on women of a specific age (postmenopausal women, age 55-85 years), rs13204965 was associated with BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine [13].\n",
      "In case of rs13245690, a sex-stratified analysis in women showed a more significant result than in pooled samples.\n",
      "These results reflect the sexual dimorphism of bone.\n",
      "Based on the different composition at different skeletal sites, all 12 loci that were significant in pooled samples showed site specificity in BMD.\n",
      "Interestingly, even though the extent of effect size was different from skeletal sites, the direction was consistent between sites.\n",
      "This indicates that BMD-associated loci commonly affect BMD determination across skeletal sites, but the different sensitivity of each site may lead to differential genetic impact on BMD variation.\n",
      "This could account for the decreased effect size of BMD loci in the Korean population.\n",
      "While the meta-analysis looked at the BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, the KARE focused on BMD at the distal radius and midshaft tibia.\n",
      "Besides, the former were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, but the latter were estimated as SOS by quantitative ultrasound.\n",
      "It has been previously shown that BMD of the radius, assessed by ultrasound, poorly coincides with radiologically assessed BMD at the lumbar spine [38].\n",
      "These represent the limitations of this study- that direct replication at specific sites cannot be performed.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some loci found in the previous GWAS still showed a directionally consistent association in this study.\n",
      "This suggests that a common mechanism underlies BMD throughout different skeletal sites.\n",
      "In order to identify putative functional variants, SNP-nexus was chosen to annotate proxy SNPs near the BMD-associated loci.\n",
      "In coding regions, some SNPs were expected to present single amino acid substitutions that could be damaging or tolerated.\n",
      "On the other hand, the other SNPs were expected to be synonymous.\n",
      "However, this type of mutation sometimes leads to unsuspected effects.\n",
      "Other annotated SNPs had possible functional effects on the regulation of splicing or the binding activity of transcription factors.\n",
      "To understand how genetic variants affect the phenotype exactly, multi-layered experimental approaches should be carried out in the future.\n",
      "In conclusion, these findings highlight the polygenic and complex variation of BMD, which could differ even by sex and skeletal site, but provide evidence of the validity in BMD-associated loci between independent populations.\n",

      "Although no SNP met the criteria of genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8), four loci (rs6978712, rs10487488, rs7690819, rs11973012) with suggestive significance were identified.\n",
      "The most significant SNP was rs6978712 (p = 4.87 × 10-7), which is located proximal to the GCC1 gene, which was previously implicated in decision-making capability in drug abusers [15].\n",
      "Three SNPs on chromosome 7 were in close proximity, and Fig.3 shows a regional association for these SNPs proximal to the GCC1 gene.\n",
      "Medication adherence averages only 50% among patients receiving treatment for chronic diseases.\n",
      "Poor medication adherence contributes to worsening disease, death, and increased health care costs.\n",
      "Moreover, if medication adherence is not guaranteed, new therapeutic options, such as personalized medicine that aims to customize healthcare to individual patients based on their genetic background, are merely useless [16].\n",
      "However, in spite of its importance in personal and social aspects, the genetic background for medication adherence has never been studied.\n",
      "Since personality traits that have a genetic background affect behaviors, including medication non-adherence, this study aimed to explore the genetic basis of medication adherence in chronic diseases for the first time.\n",
      "Among the hypertensive or diabetic patients from the KARE cohort study, 235 medication non-adherent individuals (case) and 1,067 medication adherent individuals (control) were extracted according to the self-reported treatment status for the disease from the cohort questionnaire.\n",
      "Patient self-reports are considered a simple and effective method to measure adherence, since a gold standard does not exist [1].\n",
      "Patients with cognitive impairments that can affect adherence were excluded.\n",
      "Defining rigorous phenotype criteria is paramount to the success of a case-control GWAS [17].\n",
      "Thus, the method of classifying individuals as either case or control in this study was validated by comparing the general characteristics of the case-control subjects.\n",
      "The differences in demographic factors (age and gender) and disease factors for adherence between the two groups were consistent with previous reports (Table 1) [3].\n",
      "Nevertheless, the classification criteria in this study have limitations.\n",
      "First, there is the possibility of misclassification of treatment-adherent individuals as medication non-adherent patients, because the criteria were based exclusively on current medication status for hypertension or diabetes.\n",
      "For example, patients with mild hypertension or diabetes who follow instructions from the physician to modify their diet or lifestyle as an initial therapy can be classified as medication non-adherent individuals.\n",
      "Second, the different ratio of the number of hypertensive and diabetic patients between the case and control groups can affect the GWAS results [18].\n",
      "Additionally, the risk of volunteer bias is present, in which individuals who participated in the KARE cohort possibly tended to adhere more to health care services.\n",
      "To overcome these limitations, standardized phenotype criteria for self-reported adherence, such as the five-item Medication Adherence Report Scale-MARS-5, which has already been used in various settings [19], and the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-MMAS-8, which has been validated in over 1,000 individuals with hypertension [20], can be applied in the study design.\n",
      "These criteria enable reliable and replicable classification of medication adherence [17].\n",
      "This study identified four loci that were suggestively associated with medication adherence.\n",
      "The most significantly associated SNP was rs6978712 (p = 4.87 × 10-7), which is located nearby the GCC1 gene on chromosome 7.\n",
      "Two suggestive SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8) with rs6978712 (Fig.3).\n",
      "This might be due to the close physical proximity of those three SNPs.\n",
      "GCC1 encodes a peripheral membrane protein that may have a role in the organization of the trans-Golgi network subcompartment that is associated with membrane transport [21].\n",
      "The trans-Golgi network is a major secretory pathway that sorts and directs newly synthesized proteins to subcellular destinations, including neuronal synapses.\n",
      "Increased transcription of GCC1 in the brain cortex of drug abusers has been reported in one study [15].\n",
      "This study indicates that GCC1 is involved in decision-making capabilities in drug abusers.\n",
      "Patients with chronic diseases weigh the benefits from adherence with treatment against the constraints on their daily lives and the perceived risks of treatment, such as side effects, time, money, and effort involved, either consciously or subconsciously [3].\n",
      "Thus, in the aspect of decision-making in adherence behavior, the association between medication adherence and the three SNPs proximal to the GCC1 gene identified in this study seems worthy of further research.\n",
      "The personality trait-associated SNPs were not associated with medication adherence in this study.\n",
      "Because of the multivariate association between personality traits and medication adherence, it seems difficult to apply the personality trait-associated SNPs to the medication adherence-associated SNPs directly.\n",
      "This study suggests potential evidence for a genetic basis of medication adherence in chronic disease patients.\n",
      "A complete identification of the genetic influences for medication adherence appears feasible, because medication adherence is complexly influenced by not only personality traits but also many factors, including socio-economic factors, healthcare-related factors, and demographic factors [3].\n",
      "Nevertheless, identifying genetic associations for poor medication adherence in chronic disease patients requires further research.\n",
      "It would be helpful for physicians to initiate personalized medication therapy by modifying treatment strategies, such as changing the route of administration, the complexity of treatment, and the degree of behavioral change required, for chronic disease patients with expected poor medication adherence from their genetic background.\n",

      "Gastritis is a major disease that has the potential to grow as gastric cancer.\n",
      "Gastric cancer is a very common cancer, and it is related to a very high mortality rate in Korea.\n",
      "This disease is known to have various reasons, including infection with Helicobacter pylori, dietary habits, tobacco, and alcohol.\n",
      "The incidence rate of gastritis has reported to differ between age, population, and gender.\n",
      "However, unlike other factors, there has been no analysis based on gender.\n",
      "So, we examined the high risk factors of gastritis in each gender in the Korean population by focusing on sex.\n",
      "We performed an analysis of 120 clinical characteristics and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 349,184 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the results of Anseong and Ansan cohort study in the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project.\n",
      "As the result, we could not prove a strong relation with these factors and gastritis or gastric ulcer in the GWAS.\n",
      "However, we confirmed several already-known risk factors and also found some differences of clinical characteristics in each gender using logistic regression.\n",
      "As a result of the logistic regression, a relation with hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia therapy, hypotensive or antihypotensive drug, diastolic blood pressure, and gastritis was seen in males; the results of this study suggest that vascular disease has a potential association with gastritis in males.\n",
      "Gastric cancer is a common cancer type.\n",
      "In the world, this cancer type has the second highest incidence among males and third highest among females [1].\n",
      "In Korea, the incidence rate of gastric cancer was second highest, and the mortality rate of gastric cancer was third highest among all cancer types in a 2010 Korean cancer statistics study [2].\n",
      "The incidence rate of gastric cancer differs between patient age, location, and even sex [3], because gastric cancer has various subtypes [3, 4] and a lot of risk factors [5].\n",
      "Helicobacter pylori is known for having a relation with gastric cancer [6].\n",
      "Almost all gastric cancer patients are infected with H. pylori [3].\n",
      "As known before, dietary habits also have the potential to affect gastric cancer [1].\n",
      "The incidence risk factors have differences in gastric cancer or peptic ulcers by blood type [7] and sex [8].\n",
      "Gastric cancer type also depends on patient populations or race [5].\n",
      "So, an analysis is needed to find known and unknown risk factors in diverse phenotypes [3].\n",
      "Gastritis is related with gastric cancer.\n",
      "Chronic gastric inflammation has the potential to grow into gastric cancer [9].\n",

      "There were 1,885 patients and 6,957 normal subjects.\n",
      "First, for selecting the case, we eliminated 104 patients who were diagnosed under age 20 or had unknown age.\n",
      "Then, 1,781 patients remained.\n",
      "Of these, 804 patients were men, and 977 patients were women.\n",
      "Of 6,957 normal subjects, no one was aged under 20; 3,335 were men, and 3,622 were women.\n",

      "Among 1,781 total patients, 977 patients and 804 patients were male and female, respectively.\n",
      "Patients had several disease-association factors in both genders: area, positive diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, positive diagnosis of mental disease, continual use of one or more drugs, waist, and height.\n",
      "Through previous studies, how these factors are related with gastritis was verified.\n",
      "The incidence of gastritis is affected by population, geographic variation, or lifestyle [1, 5].\n",
      "In this study, we used cohort data that comprised country and city populations.\n",
      "As shown Tables 1 and 2, in both genders, the population of local A had a higher gastritis incidence rate.\n",
      "This means that differences in patient lifestyle and environment affect the disease incidence rate.\n",
      "It is well known that stress has an influence on carcinogenesis.\n",
      "A study reported that gastritis is closely connected with mental illness [12] and differs in degree according to drug use-taking medicine affects the stomach.\n",
      "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause gastrointestinal damage [13].\n",
      "Losing appetite is the one of phenotypes of gastritis that are connected with waist size or hip size as gastritisassociated factors.\n",
      "However, definite evidence is lacking [14].\n",
      "As shown in Tables 1 and 2, we can explain the associative relation that waist size or hip size is smaller despite patients being taller than normal.\n",
      "Also, height is considered to be a gastritis risk factor.\n",
      "As shown in a previous study, higher height tends to increase the gastric cancer incidence rate [15].\n",
      "In males and females, hyperlipidemia and gastritis are related with gastritis.\n",
      "Only male cases are associated with vascular disease.\n",
      "Coronary artery has the potential to grow into myocardial infarction [16], and myocardial infarction is related with blood pressure [17].\n",
      "As previously reported, approximately 30% of patients with coronary heart disease suffer from hyperlipidemia at the same time [18].\n",
      "So, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery, and myocardial infarction are all related to each other.\n",
      "As shown in Table 1, in males, by logistic regression, there is a relation with hyperlipidemia, coronary artery, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia therapy, hypotensive or antihypotensive drug use, and diastolic blood pressure.\n",
      "This relation is more remarkable in males than in females.\n",
      "Repeatedly, it can be considered that vascular disease is connected with gastritis.\n",
      "In fact, in this study, including males and females, 16 patients had gastritis and myocardial infarction (20%), 77 patients had gastritis and hyperlipidemia (36%), and 13 patients had gastritis and coronary artery (25.5%).\n",
      "Female patients with gastritis have 4 more gastritis-associated factors by logistic regression test compared with males.\n",
      "In the case of taking osteoporosis medicine, the incidence rate is 1.7 times higher compared with normal.\n",
      "Taking anticonvulsants is a meaningful factor by logistic regression test, but few patients were taking this medicine [4]; so, it is hard to prove that taking anticonvulsants has a positive relation with gastritis.\n",
      "Patients who were diagnosed with tuberculosis and patients who have taken tuberculosis drugs suffer gastritis more than normal subjects.\n",
      "This gives information on the relation between gastritis and tuberculosis in females.\n",
      "ROC curves can show how gastritis-associated factors of Tables 1 and 2 affect gastritis patients and normal subjects.\n",
      "Whether these factors are conclusive should be confirmed by AUC values.\n",
      "Figs.1 and 2 are ROC curves using the result of the logistic regression test of Tables 1 and 2, respectively.\n",

      "Title: Foldback Intercoil DNA and the Mechanism of DNA Transposition\n",
      "\n",
      "Foldback intercoil (FBI) DNA is formed by the folding back at one point of a non-helical parallel track of double-stranded DNA at as sharp as 180° and the intertwining of two double helixes within each other's major groove to form an intercoil with a diameter of 2.2 nm.\n",
      "FBI DNA has been suggested to mediate intra-molecular homologous recombination of a deletion and inversion.\n",
      "Inter-molecular homologous recombination, known as site-specific insertion, on the other hand, is mediated by the direct perpendicular approach of the FBI DNA tip, as the attP site, onto the target DNA, as the attB site.\n",
      "Transposition of DNA transposons involves the pairing of terminal inverted repeats and 5-7-bp tandem target duplication.\n",
      "FBI DNA configuration effectively explains simple as well as replicative transposition, along with the involvement of an enhancer element.\n",
      "The majority of diverse retrotransposable elements that employ a target site duplication mechanism is also suggested to follow the FBI DNA-mediated perpendicular insertion of the paired intercoil ends by non-homologous end-joining, together with gap filling.\n",
      "A genome-wide perspective of transposable elements in light of FBI DNA is discussed.\n",
      "The transposable element (TE) was first described by McClintock [1] as a controlling element that jumps from one position to another in the maize chromosome in the mid-1940s, long before the discovery by Watson and Crick of the double helix structure of DNA as a genetic element [2].\n",
      "It was a time when, after the rediscovery of Mendel's Law of Heredity in 1900, the cytogenetic study of chromosomes was at the forefront of genetics and when genes were thought to be beads on a string located on the chromosome.\n",
      "It was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when insertion sequence (IS) elements and transposons (Tn) were discovered and found to be similar to McClintock's controlling elements, and her AC/DS elements were confirmed at the DNA sequence level as a TE [3].\n",
      "Salient features of DNA transposable elements (dTEs), including terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), target site duplication (TSD), the transposase gene, and simple and replicative transposition mechanisms have been well established by extensive molecular biology and biochemistry studies [4].\n",
      "Then, retrotransposable elements (rTEs), including long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons, non-LTR-retrotransposons, and other retro-elements, were being added to the repertoire since the 1980s to make the picture diverse and complicated [5].\n",
      "Many new families of TEs are being added, especially from eukaryotes, even by computational screening in the post-genome era, which has necessitated a new classification based on their structures and mechanisms of transposition [6].\n",
      "The presence of foldback intercoil (FBI) DNA was first reported by Kim in 1985 [7] and shown by a space filling model to mediate intra-molecular homologous recombination of inversions and deletions.\n",
      "It was further shown in 1987 that FBI DNA can mediate inter-molecular DNA rearrangements, such as site-specific insertions, at the foldback tip and DNA transpositional integration at the intercoil end of the detached dTE [8].\n",
      "It will be examined in this review how FBI DNA mediation of transposition can be extended to different classes and families of rTEs.\n",
      "Readers are suggested to refer to many good reviews available on the classification, structures, genetic contents, and function of the gene products and on the mechanisms of transposition with excellent diagrammatic illustrations [5, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n",
      "This review will minimize duplicate descriptions and focus on the mechanistic features that are relevant to the application of FBI DNA to the mechanisms of DNA transposition.\n",
      "To build the basis for comparison and understand transposition mechanisms, it is necessary to consider TE structures based on the presence or absence of the following factors: 1) RNA intermediates before transposition, 2) TIRs or LTRs, 3) transposase or reverse transcriptase (RT) and other proteins related to autonomous or non-autonomous transposition, 4) TSD, and 5) other features, like DNA replication modes, hairpin structure, and enhancers.\n",
      "Transposition of dTEs involves direct movement of the dTE intermediate either by a simple cut-and-paste mechanism, as in Tn5 [13], Tn7 [14], and Tn10 [15], or by replicative transposition, in which case one copy stays in the original site and a daughter dTE copy appears in a distant location [16, 17, 18].\n",
      "Step-wise description of the transposition events includes the requirement and pairing of both dTE ends [13, 19], binding of the transposase proteins to the terminal sequences, double-strand breaks (DSBs) of the dTE terminals [14] and target ends, ligation of the 3'-OH donor end and the 5'-P target end, and gap repair of the single-strand gaps on the target that were generated by DSB [20].\n",
      "In the case of the Mu bacteriophage, the gap can be repaired while the entire transposon gets replicated in a cointegrate mechanism [21, 22].\n",
      "Transposition of rTEs involves an RNA intermediate that is reverse-transcribed by RT into a cDNA.\n",
      "This double-stranded linear DNA functions as the direct precursor for integration by an integrase protein into a new location in the host chromosome in a 'copy and paste' manner, as in the 'cut-and-paste' transposition reaction in dTEs [20, 23].\n",
      "TIRs are a hallmark of dTEs, as LTRs have been that of rTEs until they were joined by non-LTR retrotransposons, which have a 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR) and 3' UTR, as typified by LINE-1 (L1), or which has neither of the terminal elements, as typified by the Alu element.\n",
      "It becomes clear that the presence of terminal repeats in the TEs is no longer a common requirement for the transposition reaction.\n",
      "The description of the protein factors above will suffice for this review, except for the long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) open reading frames (ORFs).\n",
      "The retrotransposition and integration of LINE have been viewed as a coupled process, called target-primed reverse-transcription [5, 24].\n",
      "However, this model has recently been enhanced by the finding that L1 reverse-transcription does not require base pairing between the primer and template [25].\n",
      "Both the RT and endonuclease domains in L1 are encoded by the same ORF.\n",
      "Therefore, the cDNA that was reverse-transcribed from the mRNA expressed from the genomic copy of LINE is inserted into the host genome [9].\n",
      "TSDs are generated in almost all classes and families of TEs, except for the Helitron dTE superfamily [6, 9, 10].\n",
      "The size of the TSD varies from 2 to 11, but the sequences are not conserved.\n",
      "The size is unique to superfamilies and can be used as a diagnostic feature.\n",
      "The ubiquitous presence of TSDs, which are generated by gap fillings (GFs) after TE integration on the target [26], reflects the unity in transposition reactions, regardless of dTE or rTE, and the presence or absence of terminal repeats [22].\n",
      "Yet, the meaning of the small oligomer size of the duplicated target is seldom discussed in terms of DNA structure.\n",
      "This aspect will be dealt with below with the FBI DNA mechanism.\n",
      "Helitron, a eukaryotic dTE, is considered, together with Polintons, a third class of TEs for many unique aspects [9].\n",
      "Helitron does not have TIRs but has 5'-TC and CCTR-3' termini instead.\n",
      "They contain 16-20-bp hairpins 10-12 nucleotides inside of the 3'-end and transpose precisely between the 5'-A and T-3' with no TSD generation.\n",
      "It is known to adopt replicative rolling circle transposition [27].\n",
      "Helitrons indiscriminately capture and mobilize gene sequences and may impact hybrid vigor or heterosis in maize [28].\n",
      "The hairpin is presumed to serve as the terminator of rolling circle replication [9].\n",
      "Since the hairpin sequence corresponds to the FBI DNA motif, it will be interesting to consider whether it can not only serve as a terminator or rolling circle replication but also serve as a replication origin for its own replication and for frequent gene capture activities, which the Helitron is capable of.\n",
      "Polinton was discovered and characterized based on bioinformatics studies [27].\n",
      "Polinton is 15-20 kb long, with a 6-bp TSD and 100-1,000-bp TIR at both ends.\n",
      "Polintons code up to 10 proteins, including a family of B DNA polymerases (POLBs), a retroviral-like integrase, an A transposase, and an adenoviral-like cysteine protease.\n",
      "Polintons, however, with their structural characteristics and presence of TSD, should follow non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) with the GF transposition mechanism, as ordinary dTEs.\n",
      "What makes it unique is the presence of a self-encoded POLB and a short 1-3-bp terminal tandem repeat that supports a protein-primed self-synthesis mechanism for Polinton propagation.\n",
      "This mechanism calls for an extrachromosomal single-stranded Polinton intermediate that forms a racketlike structure and follows POLB-mediated replication to become double-stranded before being integrated into the host genome [9].\n",
      "It has been proposed that eukaryotic dTEs follow three types of transposition mechanisms according to different replication modes: cut-and-paste for most dTEs, rolling circle replication for Helitrons, and synthetic replication for Polintons [9].\n",
      "In fact, there seems to be many different cases of transposon-related replication that need to be clarified in the future.\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, continuation of DNA replication of an inserted TE molecule, like in Mu co-integration, may also fill the gap to generate TSDs.\n",
      "It should be emphasized that DNA transposition has been grouped in two: simple, conservative, or 'cut-and-paste' mechanism and replicative transposition [16, 17, 29].\n",
      "In Tn5, at the outer ends, ori-C-like 9-bp sequences are found, which may serve to direct host replication functions to the ends of the element during transposition [17].\n",
      "Transposition of Tn5 may involve replication proceeding from both ends in a symmetrical manner.\n",
      "This type of mechanism may differ from the polarized replication of other elements [17].\n",
      "A synthetic mechanism is proposed for Polinton propagation to explain protein-primed replication of a racket-like structure of a single-stranded Polinton [9].\n",
      "If it gets to be understood that the heteroduplex structure that is derived from FBI DNA may serve as the template of DNA replication, many of the diverse cases of DNA replication may be clarified (see below).\n",
      "FBI DNA is formed by the folding back at one point of a non-helical parallel track of double-stranded DNA at as sharp as 180° and the intertwining of the bent helixes within each other's major groove to form an intercoil with a diameter of 2.2 nm (Fig.1A).\n",
      "FBI DNA could be considered a double-stranded version of a hairpin or stem-and-loop structure of RNA and single-stranded DNA.\n",
      "But, such sharp bending and formation of a four-stranded intercoil are not considered possible with a double helical B-DNA with a diameter of 2.0 nm [8].\n",
      "In an extended definition, FBI DNA may contain a loop and a much longer stem under biological conditions.\n",
      "Intercoil DNA is designated to distinguish itself from supercoil DNA, which is thicker than 2.2 nm.\n",
      "Intercoil DNA is also termed to avoid the use of four-stranded DNA, which has the connotation of four-stranded base pairing among homologous repeats.\n",
      "It needs to be emphasized that intercoil DNA is formed by two intertwining duplexes of any sequence, but when homology is met at a certain region, homologous recombination may proceed via heteroduplex formation with the help of the proper enzymes involved.\n",
      "FBI DNA was first formulated based upon a rare but unique electron microscopy (EM) configuration of plant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules and space-filling models [7, 8].\n",
      "Once the FBI DNA structure was realized with the space filling model, it was possible to perform homologous recombination with direct contact of the repeat sequences.\n",
      "The intra-molecular homologous recombination of a deletion and inversion occurs via 1) synapsis of the repeats in the intercoil, 2) heteroduplex formation by 90° base flipping, and 3) nick-and-close resolution of the sugar phosphate backbone crossing over [7].\n",
      "Inter-molecular homologous recombination, known as site-specific insertion, on the other hand, is mediated by direct contact between the attP site at the tip of the FBI DNA and the attB site on the target DNA [8].\n",
      "Perpendicular approach of the foldback tip onto the target site effectively resolves the year-long topological puzzle encountered in four-stranded base pair winding of two circular DNA molecules and explains that 6- or 7-bp attP and attB sites correspond to the diameter of the approaching FBI DNA tip and the target width.\n",
      "DNA transposition is explainable by the perpendicular approach of the detached transposon ends in intercoil form to the host target, as described in detail below.\n",
      "Transposition of a dTE molecule in FBI DNA configuration is tested by a space filling model, as presented in Fig.1 and as a detailed diagram in Fig.2 [30].\n",
      "The TE molecule, detached from the host by a DSB in a blunt end cut, approaches, as shown in the diagram, at a perpendicular angle to the target site.\n",
      "Both 3'-OH ends of the TE ligate with the 5'-P ends of the staggered-cut target, leaving the overhang target ends single-stranded, which would be repaired by gap filling.\n",
      "As shown in the diagram (Fig.2), when the TE ends approach the target on the minor groove side, the target size would be 5 bp on the minor groove side and 7 bp on the major groove side.\n",
      "This explains the meaning of the average size of the 5-7-bp target duplication, as it matches the diameter of the incoming intercoil DNA, 2.2 nm.\n",
      "In reality, the target sizes vary between 2 to even over 10 bp in a TE superfamily-specific manner.\n",
      "This TSD size variation could be explained by several factors-namely, local squeeze and stretch of the DNA double helix; unequal cutting positions of the TE ends, as exemplified in Tn7 by the 3-nt overhang by staggered DSB [14]; the characteristics of the endonucleases involved; and even temporary loosening of the intercoil end during a very elaborate and concerted coordination of the transpososome structure [8].\n",
      "In earlier days, when IS and Tn, and even the LTR retrotransposons, were the major players of transposition, it was the presence of terminal repeats that attracted attention for explaining the transpositional mechanism, as in homologous recombination.\n",
      "Therefore, it was somewhat puzzling to explain the cases of non-LTR retrotransposons with asymmetric termini sequences.\n",
      "But, it is now TSD that attracts attention as a common factor for the transposition mechanism of all TEs, except for Helitrons.\n",
      "It is the structural nature of the intercoil, which is formed by intertwining duplexes, regardless of the homology between the two termini.\n",
      "When both ends of a TE synapse in the form of an intercoil, are cut by a DSB off the host duplex strand, and approach the target in perpendicular direction, their 3'-OH ends ligate to the staggered 5'-P ends of the broken target.\n",
      "The resulting overhang single-strand DNA gaps on both flanking ends of the target are repaired to generate the accompanying TSD.\n",
      "The significance of the terminal repeats is then the homologous recombination that is required for further transactions of recombination, replication, and transcription.\n",
      "The enhancer is a cis element of DNA that affects, as a third factor, DNA transactions, such as transcription, homologous recombination, and transposition [31, 32, 33, 34].\n",
      "It has remained somewhat of an enigma, because the presence of an enhancer element and its binding proteins at a distance in a sequence and orientation non-specific manner enhances the efficiency of the reaction by 1,000 times.\n",
      "Rather unique configurations of rigid rod-like DNA with a big protein complex at one end [35, 36 Fig.4-2] may shed light on the enhancer concept and give us an idea of what actually happens under cellular conditions (Fig.3).\n",
      "Folding back of a DNA duplex at a distant point would bring an enhancer site into juxtaposition with the base of a TE, which has also branched out as FBI DNA (Figs.4 and 5).\n",
      "Proteins binding to the enhancer site and to both ends of the TE and any other additional factors together would form a tight DNA-protein complex, called a transpososome.\n",
      "This transpososome would provide a tight and stable surgical platform for a series of highly concerted precision cut-and- paste reactions: namely, DSB of the TE termini, sealing of the host duplexes by NHEJ, staggered cuts on the target site, NHEJ of the TE 3'-OH ends and target 5'-P ends, and finally, gap-filling of the 5-7-nucleotide single-strand portions to flank the transposed TE.\n",
      "In replicative transposition (Fig.5), there are two possibilities [21].\n",
      "First, the gap-filling reaction during TSD may continue on to the TE molecule by displacement or polarized replication, even though the direction of replication may be reversible [20].\n",
      "Second, as shown in the diagram, TIRs in the FBI DNA configuration may transform into heteroduplexes and serve as primers for bidirectional replication of the internal TE, thus keeping one copy at the original site and depositing the other copy to the target site in juxtaposition.\n",
      "Inversion of the replicated TE may result from homologous recombination, as predicted [7, 16].\n",
      "TSD serves as a common landmark of unity on transposition mechanisms for both dTEs and rTEs.\n",
      "The only exception so far is the Helitron superfamily, which lacks TSD and employs a rolling circle replication model.\n",
      "As long as a TSD is generated during TE integration into the host chromosome, it indicates that the immediate intermediate of integration is in a double-stranded DNA form, regardless of RNA or single-stranded DNA being the initial intermediate.\n",
      "From the EM pictures of FBI and rigid rod configurations of native DNA (Fig.3), an ideal configuration of a transpososome may be envisioned.\n",
      "It becomes apparent that vertical insertion of the DSB ends of the TE in an intercoil alignment is probably the best-fitting mechanism of DNA transposition.\n",
      "Small sizes of the target, around 6-7 bp, encountered in TSD as well as in attP and attB in site-specific insertion all point to the fact that they correspond to the diameter of FBI DNA 2.2 nm.\n",
      "The transpososome, made of FBI DNA configurations of the TE and the enhancer element, may effectively abolish lingering mechanistic puzzles about keeping four broken strands of the TE and the host from flying apart and answer how a TE molecule jumps onto a new target site at a distance.\n",
      "Replicative transposition is explained likewise, even utilizing the terminal homology as a possible origin of replication.\n",
      "It would be, however, difficult, if not impossible, to reproduce such a transpososome complex in vitro by FBI DNA configuration, which is critically needed for EM observations and crystallography analysis.\n",
      "There are four main modes of transactions by which the FBI DNA motif may be utilized in DNA functions in the cell: alpha deletion, omega inversion, needle point site-specific insertion, and NHEJ-GF integration of TE [8].\n",
      "With such an abundant presence in strategically important positions in the genome and very dynamic functional roles, it is hoped that FBI DNA receives the proper recognition and interpretation for a better understanding of the life process.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although the number of protein-coding genes is not highly variable between plant taxa, the DNA content in their genomes is highly variable, by as much as 2,056-fold from a 1C amount of 0.0648 pg to 132.5 pg.\n",
      "The mean 1C-value in plants is 2.4 pg, and genome size expansion/contraction is lineage-specific in plant taxonomy.\n",
      "Transposable element fractions in plant genomes are also variable, as low as ~3% in small genomes and as high as ~85% in large genomes, indicating that genome size is a linear function of transposable element content.\n",
      "Of the 2 classes of transposable elements, the dynamics of class 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons is a major contributor to the 1C value differences among plants.\n",
      "The activity of LTR retrotransposons is under the control of epigenetic suppressing mechanisms.\n",
      "Also, genome-purging mechanisms have been adopted to counter-balance the genome size amplification.\n",
      "With a wealth of information on whole-genome sequences in plant genomes, it was revealed that several genome-purging mechanisms have been employed, depending on plant taxa.\n",
      "Two genera, Lilium and Fritillaria, are known to have large genomes in angiosperms.\n",
      "There were twice times of concerted genome size evolutions in the family Liliaceae during the divergence of the current genera in Liliaceae.\n",
      "In addition to the LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons and satellite DNAs contributed to the huge genomes in the two genera by possible failure of genome counter-balancing mechanisms.\n",
      "Although some plants exist in aquatic environments, plants are mainly denizens of land.\n",
      "Since the first brave aquatic algae landed on plants in the Silurian period about 450 million years ago, plants had spread from the tundra to tropic and aquatic lake or ocean to alpines.\n",
      "The physical mass and size are also enormously variable, from only a few millimeters long in bryophytes to over 90 meters tall in eucalyptus.\n",
      "The sessile nature and lack of obvious immune systems of green plants may have adopted different life strategies compared to species in the animal kingdom.\n",
      "The genome, the genetic material of an organism, has been adopted for ambient environments.\n",
      "As seen in the wide range of ecological niches and structural complexity, the cellular genome is also highly variable in plant species by as much as over 2,000-fold [1, 2].\n",
      "Cellular DNA content has been measured in over 6,000 plant species [1, 2], and highquality DNA sequence information is available from about 50 plant species [3].\n",
      "Prior to the genomic era, the general idea was that plant genomes constitute a large amount of 'junk' or 'parasitic' or 'selfish' DNAs [4, 5], which are mostly repetitive DNAs and transposable elements.\n",
      "However, these DNAs have been revisited with a plethora of genomic information and considered genomic gold in the evolution of eukaryotic taxa [6, 7, 8].\n",
      "The extreme genome size variation of eukaryotes, especially in plant taxa, has posited a conundrum in evolutionary genetics.\n",
      "The recently updated information of whole-genome sequences is shedding light from diverse angles to understand genome size variations with evolutionary and biological significance in many organisms.\n",
      "This review excerpts topics on genome size variation in relation with transposable elements.\n",
      "In the last session, the transposable elements and genome evolution in the Liliaceae family, known to have large genomes in angiosperms, will be discussed.\n",
      "The redundant nature of eukaryotic genomes was analyzed well before the dawn of modern genomic analysis.\n",
      "Waring and Britten [9] demonstrated that not all DNA coded for genes in eukaryotes by reassociation kinetic analysis of mouse DNA.\n",
      "The DNA reassociation kinetic analysis, Cot analysis, allows one to dissect the genomic composition in several species, in which the genomes of complex organisms can be fractionated into several classes depending on the repetitiveness, such as unique, slightly repetitive, moderately repetitive, and highly repetitive sequences [10].\n",
      "The Cot analysis was very useful in the analysis of the genome complexity in species with large genomes, such as major crop plants [11, 12, 13].\n",
      "When the eukaryotic chromosomes are dissected at the molecular level, sequence composition is not even along the chromosomes.\n",
      "While the low-copy protein coding sequences are clustered in discrete blocks between various repetitive DNA sequences, the repeated DNA sequences are located at a few defined sites or widely dispersed, depending on the classes of repetitive DNA [14, 15].\n",
      "The chromosomal landmarks of repeated sequences include centromeres, telomeres, nucleolus organizing region (NOR), and heterochromatin.\n",
      "While centromeres house highly repeated satellite DNA sequences and Ty3/gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, Ty1/copia LTR retrotransposons and microsatellites or simple sequence repeats are dispersed and present in clusters [15, 16].\n",
      "The 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA gene repeats are on the NORs, which appear as secondary constrictions in cytological preparations [14, 15].\n",
      "Another repeat of the 5S rRNA gene is also clustered in one or more sites in chromosomes [14, 15, 16].\n",
      "The chromosomal tips, telomeres, also contain many thousands of the telomere repeat TTAGGG [14, 17].\n",
      "Besides these repeat motifs, many other types of intercalary tandem repeats or dispersed repeats are also scattered along the chromosomes.\n",
      "Eukaryotic nuclear DNA is packaged into chromatin structure.\n",
      "During interphase, the local structure of chromatin depends on the genes present in the DNA.\n",
      "The low-copy protein-coding genes are loosely packaged into euchromatin, whereas sequences of protein-noncoding genes are tightly packaged into the gene desert heterochromatin.\n",
      "The local chromatin structure can be altered by epigenetic chemical modification of the DNA and chromatin-associated proteins.\n",
      "The chromatin structure dynamic is a critical process in the regulation of DNA replication, gene expression control, and cell division [18].\n",
      "Some points of the epigenetic control of gene expression and DNA replication are beyond the scope of this review; so, epigenetic chromatin modifications will be dealt here in detail only in relation with genome size and transposable elements.\n",
      "Since the discovery of transposable elements in maize in 1940s by McClintock [19, 20, 21, 22], TEs have been found to be ubiquitously present in eukaryotes [23].\n",
      "TEs are capable of moving their locations within the genome so that they can generate genomic plasticity by inducing various chromosomal mutations and allelic diversity [24, 25, 26].\n",
      "TEs are conventionally classified into two classes based on the transposition mode: class 1 TEs and class 2 TEs [27].\n",
      "Class 1 TEs are the retrotransposons that retrotranspose via an mRNA intermediate in a \"copy-and-paste\" process that can lead to extremely high copy numbers in the genome.\n",
      "Class 2 TEs comprise transposons that transpose directly via DNA by a \"cut-and-paste\" process that allows them to attain moderate copies in the genome.\n",
      "With the plethora of information of whole-genome sequences in a growing number of species [3, 28], more and more families of TEs are being mined, which necessitates the adoption of a unified classification system for TEs.\n",
      "This systematic classification groups the TEs into 2 major classes, 9 orders, and 29 superfamilies by the mode of chromosomal integration, gene structure, and sequence similarity [23].\n",
      "Class 1 TEs can be subdivided into several subclasses but generally into two subclasses: LTR retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons.\n",
      "Although both LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons are in plant genomes, LTR retrotransposons are more prevalent than non-LTR retrotransposons in plant species.\n",
      "LTRs range from a few hundred base pairs to several kb (kilobases), and LTRs start with nucleotides of 5'-TG-3' and end with 5'-CA-3'.\n",
      "Because the LTR retrotransposons integrate into 4- to 6-bp staggered cut sites, they produce 4- to 6-bp target site duplication (TSD) upon integration.\n",
      "The LTR retrotransposons encode two open reading frames, GAG and POL [29, 30, 31].\n",
      "GAG encodes a protein for replication, and POL encodes protease (PR), integrase (INT), reverse transcriptase (RT), and RNase H (RH).\n",
      "The LTR retrotransposons are divided into two superfamilies, Ty1-copia (Pseudovirideae) and Ty3-gypsy (Metavirideae), based on the order of genes they encode [23].\n",
      "The overall sequences are similar, but the gene order is PR-INT-RT-RH in Ty1-copia and PR-RT-INT-RH in Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons, respectively.\n",
      "Phylogenetic analyses of the RT domain revealed a monophyletic origin of the Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy subfamilies [32, 33].\n",
      "Moreover, the high sequence similarity and gene structure between Ty3-gypsy elements and retroviruses indicate that retroviruses evolved from Ty3-gypsy elements by acquisition of the env gene [31, 34].\n",
      "Although non-LTR retrotransposons are less prevalent than LTR retrotransposons in plant taxa, four main orders of class 1 non-LTR retrotransposons, Dictyostelium intermediate repeat sequence, Penelope-like element), long interspersed nuclear elements and short interspersed nuclear element), are found in plants [23, 31].\n",
      "DIRSs carry unusual split direct repeats or an inverted repeat at both ends and do not produce TSD upon integration.\n",
      "Termini of PLE elements are LTR-like, but their orientation can be either a direct or an inverted orientation.\n",
      "They have an RT and endonuclease domain, and the RT domain of PLE is more similar to telomerase than the RT of LTR retrotransposons.\n",
      "Both long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) lack LTRs at their termini.\n",
      "While LINEs can reach several kb, SINEs are short (80-500 bp).\n",
      "LINEs are predominant elements in animal genomes, whereas they are not prevalent in plant genomes except the Del-2 element, which is highly abundant in the genomes of species in the genus Lilium.\n",
      "The Del-2 elements will be discussed in more detail in the following session.\n",
      "Of the five major superfamilies (R2, L1, RTE, I, and Jokey) in the LINE order, only L1 and I are present in plant genomes [23, 31].\n",
      "SINEs are also highly abundant in animal genomes, especially in mammalian genomes; they are relatively less dominant in plant genomes.\n",
      "The best known SINE is the Alu element, which is present in up to 500,000 copies in the human genome [35].\n",
      "The origin of SINEs is obscure and is presumed to have originated from various polymerase III transcripts.\n",
      "Their AT-rich 3'-region carries 35-bp tandem repeats or contains a poly(T) tail, the pol III termination signal [35].\n",
      "Class II DNA transposons can be subdivided into subclass 1 of terminal inverted repeat (TIR) transposons and subclass 2 of non-TIR transposons [23, 31].\n",
      "The subclass 1 TIR DNA transposons are flanked by various lengths of TIRs and produce various lengths of small TSDs upon integration.\n",
      "The TIR transposons encode a transposase, which excises the element from the genome and integrates into a new site in the genome, because it has both endonuclease and ligase activity [36, 37, 38].\n",
      "The TIRs form a secondary structure where transposases bind.\n",
      "Most of the known transposases carry a DDE catalytic motif, which comes in close proximity to each other and forms a catalytic center to enable the enzyme to excise the transposon DNA from the original site and reinsert it into the target site [39].\n",
      "The subclass 1 TIR DNA transposons are classified into 10 superfamilies based on the sequence similarities.\n",
      "Of the 10 superfamilies, plant genomes harbor 6 superfamilies: Tc-Mariner, hAT, Mutator, P, PIF-Harbinger, and CACTA.\n",
      "In the subclass 2 non-TIR DNA transposons, two non-TIR DNA transposon superfamilies, Helitrons and Maverick, are present.\n",
      "Helitrons are widespread, diverse, and abundant in some plants, but their identification is difficult due to their lack of a terminal repeat structure [40].\n",
      "The Helitrons replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism and do not produce TSDs upon integration.\n",
      "Helitrons can attain very high copy numbers and create genomic diversity.\n",
      "Indeed, they are present in high copies, and captured gene fragments of pseudogenes contribute to maize genome diversity [41, 42, 43].\n",
      "Depending on the movability both class 1 and class 2 TEs can be further classified into autonomous and non-autonomous elements.\n",
      "While the autonomous elements equip all the machinery in mobilizing themselves, the non-autonomous elements lack one or all of the components of this machinery [44].\n",
      "The non-autonomous elements are decayed autonomous elements by deletion or other mutations, but they are highly abundant in plant genomes [23].\n",
      "Transposition of class 1 elements is a multi-step process.\n",
      "That is, they must be transcribed and translated to produce proteins to reverse-transcribe the mRNA and package it into virus-like particles.\n",
      "The non-autonomous class 1 retrotransposons lack self-encoded proteins, so that the multi-step is blocked.\n",
      "However, they can be mobilized if the missing proteins are provided in trans [45].\n",
      "The BARE1 and BARE2 elements illustrate an example of the autonomy and non-autonomy of the class 1 retrotransposons.\n",
      "BARE1 (Barley RetroElement1) is a copia-like retrotransposon and highly abundant in the barley genome [46].\n",
      "It is an autonomous element, and the protein machinery encoded is produced.\n",
      "The BARE2 is a non-autonomous element, having most of its protein-coding domains intact, except for the defective Gag gene.\n",
      "The defect of BARE2 was complemented by the BARE1 machinery to retrotranspose in the barley genome [47].\n",
      "In class 2 DNA transposons, the non-autonomous elements cannot express transposase to catalyze their own transposition.\n",
      "Because they were derived from autonomous elements, they form a binary system in terms of mobilization, which was recognized in the Ac/Ds system by the early pioneering observation in maize by McClintock [22].\n",
      "miniature inverted repeat transposable elements) are worthwhile mentioning here among the non-autonomous class 1 transposons [48, 49, 50].\n",
      "Because MITEs are small and carry only the minimal feature of TIR, they have been elusive in the identification of autonomous elements to mobilize them to attain very high copies in plant genomes.\n",
      "By an extensive bioinformatics search, it was revealed that Stowaway MITEs were derived from the Tc1/mariner superfamily, and Tourist MITEs were derived from the PIF/Harbinger superfamily [51].\n",
      "Thus, it was deduced that MITEs can burst by autonomous elements in these superfamilies.\n",
      "C-value or genome size refers to the total amount of DNA in an unreplicated haploid or gametic nucleus of an organism [52].\n",
      "C-value varies tremendously by as much as 660,000-fold among eukaryotes, from 2.3 Mb in Encephalitozoon intestinalis, a parasitic microsporidian, to 148,880 Mb in Paris japonica, a monocotyledonous plant in Liliales [53, 54, 55].\n",
      "The general trend of C-value is that simple organisms have small genomes and complex higher organisms have large genomes.\n",
      "However, the C-value variation is even present among closely related species, and genomic DNA content is often poorly correlated with organismal complexity, which projects the C-value paradox [56].\n",
      "Plant taxa show more C-value variation than other taxa (Table 1) [3, 57].\n",
      "Among land plants, the genome size variation is as much as a 2,348-fold difference from the smallest, Genlisea margaretae (1C = 63.4 Mbp), to the largest, Paris japonica (1C = 148,880 Mb).\n",
      "Large size differences exist even in a single genus at the same ploidy level as in the genus Eleocharis, which comprises more than 250 species, in which E. acicularis (2n = 20, C = 0.25 pg) is 20 times smaller than E. palustris (2n = 16, C = 5.5 pg) [58].\n",
      "Using Feulgen microdensitometry or flow cytometry, C-value has been measured in over 6,000 plant species and categorized in the Kew Plant DNA C-value Databases (http://data.kew.org/cvalues/) [1, 2].\n",
      "The average genome size (1C) is 5.809 Gbp (1 pg = 980 Mbp) in angiosperms and 18.157 Gbp in gymnosperms, respectively.\n",
      "The median 1C-value is 2.401 Gbp for angiosperms and 17.506 Gbp for gymnosperms, respectively; indicating that genome size in angiosperms is not evenly distributed but skewed, favoring a small size.\n",
      "With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the list of complete genomes that have been sequenced is growing sharply to provide deep insights into genomic evolution by comparing whole-genome information [28, 59, 60].\n",
      "In plants, genome sequences are available in more than 50 species, including 36 dicots, 16 monocots, 1 gymnosperm, and 1 each of a lycophyte and bryophyte [28].\n",
      "The genome size in the list ranges from the smallest genome of the carnivorous Utricularia gibba (bladderwort) at 82 Mb [61] to the largest genome of a gymnosperm species, Picea abies (Norway spruce), at 19,800 Mbp [62].\n",
      "The most frequent genome size of the sequenced plant genomes is about 500 Mbp, which is similar to the average genome size in the Kew Plant DNA C-value Database (http://data.kew.org/cvalues).\n",
      "Repeated DNA sequences are predominant in the plant genome.\n",
      "The repeat sequences range from 3% of the small genome of U. gibba [61] to 85% of the large genome of maize [63].\n",
      "Transposable elements constitute most of the repeated DNAs.\n",
      "Of the two classes of transposable elements, class 1 retrotransposons constitute significant proportions in plant genomes.\n",
      "Of the first 50 plant genomes sequenced, the number of full-length LTR retrotransposons is available in 21 species, in which the genome size increment correlated with the abundance of repeated sequences (r2 = 0.584) and LTR retrotransposons (r2 = 0.68) [28].\n",
      "The \"cut-and-paste\" class 2 DNA transposons multiply their copies when the transpositions occurs from a recently replicated genomic region into unreplicated genomic regions or when the excision site is repaired by gene conversion using the intact sister chromatid as a template [64].\n",
      "Thus, the class 2 DNA transposons do not usually attain high copy numbers, and their impact on genome size is minimal.\n",
      "Among class 2 elements, MITEs are an exception in copy number, because they are present at extremely high copy numbers in some genomes [65, 66].\n",
      "However, the small size of MITEs, 200-500 bp, has a limitation on their impact on genomic obesity [67].\n",
      "The semiconservative \"copy-and-paste\" transposition can increase copy numbers of the class 1 retrotransposons continuously.\n",
      "Indeed, the magnitude of C-value variation in plant genomes cannot be explained solely by whole genome duplication (WGD), and genome contents are highly correlated with the amount of class 1 retrotransposons among the sequenced genomes [28, 67].\n",
      "Unless there are mechanisms of removing these class 1 retrotransposons or other repeated sequences, plants may end up with a 'one-way ticket' to genomic obesity [68].\n",
      "Does a large genome actually cause any problem in the adaptation of host species?\n",
      "In a sense, the dramatic increase of noncoding or repeated sequences must give some burden to the cell for replication and metabolism, which was postulated by the 'large genome constraint hypothesis' [69].\n",
      "That is, the nutritional requirements of the extra phosphorus (P), a major constituent of DNA, and subsequent longer replication times may result in longer generation times and a reduction in fecundity, leading to selective disadvantage [70].\n",
      "Actually, plants having a 1C-value of less than 3 pg could be annual, biennial, or perennial, whereas plants having a 1C-value of larger than 25 pg cannot grow quickly enough to be annual and are to be obligate perennials [71].\n",
      "Genome sizes of angiosperms are skewed, favoring a small size, except for a few extreme large genomes [1, 67].\n",
      "The fact that lower unicellular organisms usually have relatively small genomes implies that genomic obesity by redundant sequences must have posed a negative impact on their survival.\n",
      "Nevertheless, some plant genomes have survived with so many burdensome large fractions of repeated DNAs, implying that the negative effect of redundant DNAs may have been negated by some compensation.\n",
      "Of the 50 sequenced plant genomes, the median C-value was about 500 Mbp.\n",
      "The species with around 500 Mbp genomes (rice, sorghum, etc.)\n",
      "have genomes that are about 30% transposable elements; so, it was argued that the average transposable element fraction is around 30% of the plant genomes [28].\n",
      "Large genome information with high accuracy and effective bioinformatics tools have unveiled the biological roles of repeated DNAs, for which several excellent reviews are available on this aspect [6, 72, 73, 74].\n",
      "The ever increasing class 1 retrotransposons can be counterbalanced by genome-purging mechanisms that include illegitimate or unequal recombination between LTRs and other types of deletions [75].\n",
      "Intrastrand homologous recombination between directly repeated LTRs deletes the sequences between LTRs, leaving solo LTRs [76].\n",
      "Analysis of solo LTRs and comparison of internally deleted retrotransposons showed that illegitimate intrastrand homologous recombination may be the driving force to maintain slim genomes in Arabidopsis [77] and rice [78].\n",
      "Recently inserted TEs are often removed from the genome, leading to rapid genomic turnover.\n",
      "For example, the rice genome experienced several bursts of LTR retrotransposons during the last 5 million years but ultimately removed over half of the inserted LTR retrotransposon DNA [79].\n",
      "The cotton genus, Gossypium, provided another example genome expansion and contraction.\n",
      "The diploid Gossypium species showed 3-fold differences in genome size, from 88 Mbp in the D-genome of New World cotton to 2,572 Mbp in the K-genome of Australian cotton [80].\n",
      "Gorge3 is a gypsy-like retrotransposon in the Gossypium species.\n",
      "The expansion and contraction of Gorge 3 were lineage-specific phylogenetically among Gossypium species.\n",
      "The smaller genomes showed not only slow gain of Gorge3 compared to the larger genomes but also effective removal of Gorge3 elements, which exceeded the rate of the gain [76].\n",
      "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) after double-strand break (DSB) can also lead to massive genomic restructuring by purging LTR retrotransposons in a small genome [81].\n",
      "The genome of Oryza brachyantha is 60% smaller than its close relative cultivating species, Oryza sativa, in which 50% of the size difference was due to the amplification and deletion of recent LTR retrotransposons.\n",
      "Of the 32,038 protein-coding genes of O. brachyantha, only 70% of them were in collinear positions in comparison with the rice genome.\n",
      "So, the authors argued that the low LTR retrotransposon activity and massive internal deletions of the LTRs by NHEJ after DSB shaped the current O. brachyantha genome.\n",
      "Similarly, NHEJ after DSB was found to be a common pathway in the genomic reduction of A. thaliana [82].\n",
      "The genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies) sheds another interesting view on genomic evolution in gymnosperms.\n",
      "It is the only genome sequenced in gymnosperms [62] and the largest genome among the first 50 sequenced plant genomes [28].\n",
      "The sequence data showed no evidence of WGD since the divergence with angiosperms 350 million years ago.\n",
      "Surprisingly, LTR retrotransposons of the Norway spruce genome are mostly low-copy LTRs with 80% singletons.\n",
      "The large genome seems to have resulted from a slow but steady accumulation of diverse LTR retrotransposons, which was possible due to the lack of efficient elimination mechanisms, as evidenced by the fact that other pine species also have low-copy LTRs [80].\n",
      "The 24-nucleotide small RNAs are involved in TE silencing [83], but expression of these small RNAs in Norway spruce is also low.\n",
      "The average gymnosperm genomes are relatively larger than those of angiosperms.\n",
      "But, the gymnosperms have not gone awry to obese genomes, as seen in some angiosperm species.\n",

      "Arabidopsis lyrata revealed several interesting phenomena on genomic contraction and expansion.\n",
      "It is an out-crossing relative to the self-pollinating model species A. thaliana.\n",
      "The A. lyrata genome is 1.6 times larger than that of A. thaliana [84].\n",
      "Comparison of the two genomes revealed that there were large-scale genome rearrangements, but most differences in genome size were derived from hundreds of thousands of small deletions in A. thaliana, mostly in non-coding areas and retrotransposons [84].\n",
      "A subsequent comparative study with other plant genomes showed that A. thaliana lost introns 6 times faster than A. lyrata [77].\n",
      "In a genome-wide survey of synonymous substitution rates, A. thaliana had a higher mutation rate than A. lyrata, which might relate to the higher rate of intron loss and rapid genome reduction [85].\n",
      "In the mutational hazard hypothesis [86], non-coding DNA is prone to accumulate deleterious mutations and be purged.\n",
      "So, with the high mutation rate in A. thaliana and intron loss, the DNA loss process may still be ongoing in A. thaliana genomes, suggesting pervasive selection for smaller genomes [84].\n",
      "Transposon insertions and copy number increases are potentially detrimental to the host genome.\n",
      "As a consequence, eukaryotic genomes employ epigenetic surveillance systems that allow TEs to be under-controlled.\n",
      "Ironically, however, Nina Fedoroff proposed a somewhat different view on plant genome size variations with transposable elements in her seminal AAAS presidential address: \"I argue that transposable elements accumulate in eukaryotic genomes because of, not despite, epigenetic silencing mechanisms\" [26].\n",
      "Nevertheless, epigenetic regulations of the transposable elements are the first line of defense against uncontrolled transposable element proliferation [75].\n",
      "Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression and do not involve changes in DNA sequence.\n",
      "They include DNA methylation [83, 87, 88], chromatin remodeling [89], and siRNAs [88, 89].\n",
      "By genomic, epigenomic, and population genetic analyses with A. thaliana, Hollister and Gaut [83] presented three results: i) gene expression is negatively correlated with the density of methylated TEs, ii) methylated TEs near genes are under purifying selection, but unmethylated TEs or TEs far from genes are not under purifying selection, and iii) TE insertions are distributed by age and methylation status, so that older, methylated TEs are farther from genes.\n",
      "Thus, host silencing of TEs near genes has deleterious effects on neighboring gene expression, resulting in the preferential loss of methylated TEs from gene-rich euchromatic regions.\n",
      "The young LTRs near genes are targeted for DNA methylation by guidance of 24-nt small interfering RNA, which results in the silencing of LTRs as well as silencing of expression of nearby genes [83, 88].\n",
      "The comparison of A. thaliana with its LTR-laden and larger relative A. lyrata can back up this view, because LTRs in A. thaliana are further from genes by more effective purging than those of A. lyrata [84, 88].\n",
      "So, it is an evolutionary trade-off in which beneficial TE silencing casts a fitness cost by the deleterious effects on the expression of nearby genes [83].\n",
      "In maize, the mop1 mutant has a deficiency of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway [89].\n",
      "In a global gene expression analysis of the mop1 mutant, most of the class 2 DNA transposons (78%) showed increased expression, but 68% of the analyzed class 1 retrotransposons showed decreased expression [90].\n",
      "Several histone deacetylases, enzymes involved in heterochromatin formation, increased their expression in the mop1 mutant, implying increased heterochromatin formation in the mutant.\n",
      "Thus, there are several pathways that lead to TE silencing, and these pathways interact with each other, so that some families are rigorously suppressed but expression of some families is relaxed, which permits a rapid burst of some transposable families in a short period of time [84, 91].\n",
      "The genomes of the species in Liliaceae are highly variable in 1C-value, ranging from 3.4 pg in Prosartes smithii to 127.4 pg in Fritillaria assyriaca [92].\n",
      "Especially, the species in the subclasses Lilieae and Tulipeae in the Lilioideae subfamily harbor large genomes in the Liliaceae family.\n",
      "By comparative analysis of the relationship of genome size with phylogenetic among 78 species in Liliaceae, Leitch et al.\n",
      "[92] demonstrated that the ancestral genome size of the Liliaceae species was 6.73 pg, and punctuated genome size evolution occurred twice in Liliaceae.\n",
      "The first genome size evolution was at the base of the polytomy divergence in Liliaceae, which was associated with a shift from the smaller genomes to the larger genomes of the Lilioideae (median C value, 14.2-50.9 pg) and Medeoloideae (median C value, 14.2-18.9 pg) subfamilies.\n",
      "Table 2 shows the genomic features of two genera, Lilium and Fritillaria, in the Lilioideae subfamily.\n",
      "The second genomic evolution was at the divergence of Lilioideae from Medeoloideae, which was about 12 million years ago [93].\n",
      "Punctuated genomic evolution that led to speciation was also observed at the molecular level in other species [94].\n",
      "The subfamily Medeoloideae is a sister subfamily to Lilioideae in the Liliaceae family.\n",
      "While the species in Medeoloideae bear rhizomes, inconspicuous flowers, fleshy animal-dispersed fruits, and broad reticulate-veined leaves, the species in Lilioideae show bulbs, showy flowers, winddispersed seeds, and narrow parallel-veined leaves in open habitats [93, 95].\n",
      "Because these ecological shifts and the adaptive morphological features coincided with the appearance of a large genome size, an adaptive role of genome size in Lilioideae is suggested-i.e., if the large genome has any selective advantage.\n",
      "However, as argued by Leitch et al.\n",
      "[92], there was no tendency toward increasing genome size from the ancestral species, having about 6.73 pg.\n",
      "Their proposal was that the large genomes of Lilioideae were a necessary or random consequence, simply due to the large diversification at the base of the clade.\n",
      "Oliver et al.\n",
      "[96] proposed a theory that genomic size evolution is proportional to genome size, with the fastest rates occurring in the larger genomes, among 20 major eukaryotic clades.\n",
      "So, the larger genomes of Lilium and Fritillaria in Lilioideae might have drifted away to even larger genomes with an increased rate of genome size evolution [92].\n",
      "Although species in the genus Lilium have been known to carry large genomes, studies of transposable elements have not been carried out extensively.\n",
      "The genome of the species in the genus Lilium spans from 32.8 to 47.9 pg, with a mean value of 39.6 pg [92].\n",
      "A Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon, del-1, was isolated from Lilium henryi [86].\n",
      "Del-1 Ty3/gypsy was present in approximately 13,000 copies in the L. henryi genome, which accounts for 1% of the genome of L. henryi.\n",
      "By DNA reassociation analysis, Joseph et al.\n",
      "[97] showed that Cot1 repeated DNAs constitute 2.2% of the L. henryi genome, whereas they constitute 9.7% in L. longiflorum.\n",
      "In a Southern blot analysis with 14 Lilium species, del-1 Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons showed high copy variation, at least a 100-fold difference, among Lilium species, implying that the del-1 Ty3/gypsy element was highly active after divergence of the genus Lilium.\n",
      "The integration time of del-1 Ty3/gypsy was estimated to be about 0.6 million years ago (mya) in L. henryi and 1.6 mya in L. longiflorum [16].\n",

      "Del-2 is 4.5 kb in size and is present in 240,000 copies, constituting about 4% of the L. speciosum genome [99].\n",
      "Del-2-related sequences were also highly abundant in Tulip and bluebells (Scilla nonsripta, both in Liliaceae), Hyacinthaceae, Amarylidaceae, and Alliaceae plants but less abundant in other monocots, such as Poaceae, implying that they are specific to the Liliaceae family.\n",
      "LINEs are highly abundant in mammals, but they are scant in most plant species [23, 31].\n",
      "However, the del-2 LINE-like elements are highly abundant in species of the Liliaceae family.\n",
      "LIREs (lily retroelement) are Ty1/copia retrotransposons isolated from L. longiflorum [16].\n",
      "LIREs showed approximately the same abundance as the del-1 Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon in species of the genus Lilium.\n",
      "However, unlike the del2 LINEs, LIRE Ty1/copia retrotransposons are absent in other species, such as tulips, Narcissus, Ipheion, Hosta longgips, and O. sativa.\n",
      "We mined eight Ty1/copia elements from Lilium lancifolium (unpulished).\n",
      "Characterization of these retrotransposons may provide more information on the Ty1/copia retrotransposons in the genus Lilium.\n",

      "30.8 pg, max.\n",
      "89.2 pg, mean 50.9 pg) than Lilium species [92].\n",
      "In F. affinis (1C = 45.6 pg) and F. imperialis (1C = 43.0 pg), chromovirus-like sequences and Tat lineage Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons are predominant in both species [100].\n",
      "Not only do retrotransposons contribute to the gigantic Fritillaria genome, satellite DNAs also FriSAT1 repeats also contribute highly to the Fritillaria genome.\n",
      "The FriSAT1 repeats constitute approximately 26% of the F. affinis genome [100].\n",
      "With these results, they argued that there are no predominant repeats that track the increasing/decreasing trends of genome size in Fritillaria.\n",
      "Instead, many diverse families of transposable elements and repeats constitute the gigantic Fritillaria genomes.\n",
      "Thus, as evidenced with full-genome sequencing of the large genome of Norway spruce (P. abies) [80, 82], the highly obese Fritillaria genome may have had happened partly by the failure of the repeats to be purged effectively to counterbalance the amplification of retrotransposons.\n",
      "Large fractions of eukaryotic genomes contain repeated DNA sequences that are mostly transposable elements.\n",
      "The large quantity of accurate genomic information in various plant taxa and the development of computational biology have revolutionized our conventional view on transposable elements, which were once dishonorably christened 'selfish DNAs' and have now been switched to 'genome treasure.'\n",
      "Genome size variation is enormously variable in plant taxa, and most of this variation is due to the variable amounts of class 1 LTR retrotransposons in the host genomes.\n",
      "The 'copy-and-paste' retrotransposition of the class 1 LTR retrotransposons left the plant genomes to get into genomic obesity.\n",
      "The uncontrollable amplification of class 1 LTR retrotransposons could have caused a negative effect on host genomes not only by the various mutational effects but also by the large genomic constraint in replication.\n",
      "Thus, epigenetic surveillance systems control the activity of retrotransposons and counterbalance genome size amplification by genome-purging mechanisms, such as illegitimate or unequal recombination between LTRs and NHEJ.\n",
      "The epigenetic surveillance systems, however, might have been weakened in certain times, and some retrotransposons in certain lineages had escaped the epigenetic radar to have an amplification burst in a relatively short period of time during plant evolution and diversification.\n",
      "However, this specific amplification might have not happened in all plant taxa, as seen in the Norway spruce, which has a relatively larger genome than average angiosperm genomes.\n",
      "Although we need more gymnosperm sequence information, the steady accumulation of diverse LTR retrotransposons with weakly efficient elimination mechanisms can also account for the genome sizes in gymnosperms.\n",
      "In addition to LTR retrotransposon amplification, as seen in Lilium and Fritillaria, non-LTR retrotransposons and simple satellite DNAs also contributed to the large genomes that happened partly by the failure of effective purging to counterbalance the growth of genome size.\n",
      "Biological (hybridization, alien chromatin introgression, environmental stresses, or pathogens, etc) and nonbiological (temperature shift, UV irradiation, etc.)\n",

      "TEs are prevalent in all plants and animals.\n",
      "In mammals, TEs and their remnants make up almost half of the genome, and in some plants, they constitute up to 90% of the genome [2].\n",
      "TEs consist of two major classes: DNA transposons and retrotransposons.\n",
      "DNA transposons are capable of moving and inserting into new genomic sites [3].\n",
      "Although they are currently not mobile in the human genome, they were active during early primate evolution until ~37 million years ago (Mya) [4].\n",
      "Retrotransposons replicate by forming RNA intermediates, which are then reverse-transcribed to make DNA sequences and inserted into new genomic locations [4].\n",
      "Based on the presence of long terminal repeats (LTRs), retrotransposons are further classified into two groups: LTR and non-LTR transposons.\n",
      "In humans, LTR elements are called human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs).\n",
      "It is estimated that HERVs inserted into the human genome >25 Mya [5, 6].\n",
      "Non-LTR retrotransposons include long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1), Alu, and SVA elements.\n",
      "Studies have revealed that these are the only TEs that are currently active in humans [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\n",
      "TEs have driven genome evolution in multiple ways.\n",
      "Retrotransposons comprise a large proportion of the genome, especially in plants and mammals.\n",
      "The effect of the increase in retrotransposons has been tolerated during evolution.\n",
      "Accumulating literature has proven that mobile elements are useful tools for studying genome evolution and gene function [12].\n",
      "A comparative analysis has shown that the human genome makes 655 perfect full-length matches with vertebrate TEs.\n",
      "TE insertions have been shown to have many effects, such as regulation of gene expression, increased recombination rate, and unequal crossover.\n",
      "TE insertions have caused many effective changes in the human genome, and the selected changes have been responsible for the evolution of the human lineage [13].\n",
      "The human genome contains many recently inserted active TEs, such as AluYa5, AluYb8, and AluYc1.\n",
      "Alu elements are a family of primate-specific short interspersed DNA elements.\n",
      "Various studies have proposed that Alu element insertions have created many variants that can potentially be used as DNA markers in human population studies, as well as in forensic analyses.\n",
      "Kass et al.\n",
      "[14] have identified an Alu-based polymorphism that consists of four alleles, from which the evolutionary order can be predicted.\n",
      "The effects of TEs on genetic instability and human diseases have not been thoroughly studied.\n",
      "The mobile property of TEs is the reason for their mutational potential.\n",
      "TE insertions may create a broad range of effects on humans, ranging from silent mutations to alternative splicing.\n",
      "Both insertions and excisions of TEs can cause genomic instability, thus causing many human diseases, including genetic disorders, psychiatric problems, and cancer [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\n",
      "Furthermore, TE insertions may result in insertional mutations, non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), creation of novel regulatory sequences, and epigenetic changes [22].\n",
      "A large number of human diseases that are associated with NAHR between Alu elements have been reported [22].\n",
      "Technical advances have helped to detect TE-associated diseases and develop novel biomarkers for clinical diagnostics.\n",
      "Computational tools have been developed to study the dynamics of transposition at a population level, thus providing critical insights into the mechanisms behind genome evolution.\n",
      "Finally, combining the genomic materials from diverse individuals followed by high-throughput sequencing can enhance the significance of characterizing genomic polymorphisms in a population [23].\n",
      "In this review, we will provide updates on our current understanding of the roles of TEs in genome evolution and genetic instability.\n",
      "Further, we focus on how their activity affects gene expression and causes disease states in human beings.\n",
      "Brain evolution is an important process that accelerated the evolution of humans.\n",
      "This occurred due to natural selection and genomic variation, a major source of which has been TE insertions.\n",
      "TE insertions contributed markedly to variation and increased the speed of evolution [24, 25, 26].\n",
      "Furthermore, they increase the recombination rate, in addition to affecting genes and their expression [24, 26].\n",
      "From an evolutionary perspective, humans are unique in the speed of evolution and the number and activity of TEs.\n",
      "It is proposed that the high frequency of TE insertions is responsible at least in part for the rapid evolution of humans.\n",
      "It is speculated that some sets of genes might have been activated or suppressed due to variations caused by TE insertions, which in turn increased the chances for evolution [13].\n",
      "There has been a prominent impact of retrotransposons on human evolution at the genomic level.\n",
      "Retrotransposons have shaped human evolution at the RNA level through various mechanisms, such as modulation of gene expression, RNA editing, and epigenetic regulation [27].\n",
      "Title: LTR retrotransposons\n",
      "\n",
      "In humans, LTR retrotransposons are called HERVs (Fig.1), which constitute 5% of the genome.\n",
      "The human genome shows 99% similarity with chimpanzees and bonobos.\n",
      "Hence, the differences between these species are likely to be in regulatory sequences: promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals, and transcription factor (TF) binding sites.\n",
      "The LTRs of HERVs help in regulating the expression of nearby genes.\n",
      "The active human-specific LTRs that have been identified belong to the HERV-K family.\n",
      "It is proposed that some of these endogenous retroviruses may have integrated into regulatory regions of the human genome and that they eventually contributed to human evolution [28].\n",
      "Khodosevich et al.\n",
      "[28] suggested that regulatory sequences found in retroviral LTRs may alter the expression of (or even inactivate) adjacent genes.\n",
      "On the other hand, HERV insertion may benefit the host, for example, by reverting harmful mutation [28].\n",
      "Title: Non-LTR retrotransposon\n",
      "\n",
      "Human non-LTR retroposons include both active (L1, Alu, and SVA) and inactive elements (L2 and mammalian-wide interspersed repeat).\n",
      "Although more than 500,000 copies of L1 elements are found in the human genome, only 100 copies are known to be intact [29].\n",
      "An intact L1 element is approximately 6 kilobases (kb) in length, with a 5' untranslated region (UTR) containing an internal RNA polymerase II promoter, two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2), and a 3' UTR (Fig.1) [29, 30].\n",
      "L1 elements are the only autonomous TEs in the human genome because of their retrotransposition property, called target-primed reverse transcription [27].\n",
      "Alu elements are often called \"a parasite's parasite,\" because they do not code for a polymerase and, hence, are non-autonomous in nature.\n",
      "Alu elements depend on L1 elements for retrotransposition machinery [31, 32, 33].\n",
      "However, they are considered the most successful TEs in the human genome in terms of copy number [27].\n",
      "An intact SVA element is approximately 2 kb in length, which includes a hexamer repeat, an Alu-like region, a variable number of tandem repeats, and a HERV-K10-like sequence.\n",
      "SVA elements are also non-autonomous and most likely depend on L1 retrotransposition machinery [34, 35].\n",
      "Two key features of non-LTR retrotransposons that control retrotransposition activity are high copy number and continued activity over millions of years [5, 27].\n",
      "From an evolutionary perspective, the observed uniqueness of non-LTR retrotransposons is due to their vertical transfer in both primates and mammals [4, 5, 36].\n",
      "Amplification rates among non-LTR retrotransposons are not uniform (Alu, 40 Mya; L1, 12-40 Mya; SVA, 6 Mya) [27].\n",
      "Among non-LTR retrotransposons, Alu elements are the most thoroughly studied in relation to evolution.\n",
      "Alu repeats may cause genomic diversity in various ways.\n",
      "Their amplification has enabled them to become the largest family of mobile elements in the human genome.\n",
      "It is estimated that thousands of Alu elements have integrated into the human genome since the divergence of humans and African apes [37, 38, 39, 40].\n",
      "Although some Alu insertions have caused harmful mutations, most have contributed to genetic diversity [8].\n",
      "Moreover, Alu repeats have also influenced the accumulation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome [30, 40, 41].\n",
      "From previous reports, it is evident that most of the recent Alu insertions are the source of genetic variations, which have been useful for studying both the relationships between populations and the evolution and organization of tandem-arrayed gene families [37, 38, 39, 40].\n",
      "Batzer and Deninger [42] suggested that the Alu insertion, in relation to genetic variation, may also be useful in generating species-specific genetic markers.\n",
      "TEs can cause genomic instability either by insertions or by rearrangements in the genome.\n",
      "Notably, structural variations in the human genome are the primary cause of inter-individual variability.\n",
      "Structural variations include insertion, deletion, inversion, duplication, and translocation.\n",
      "The characteristics of TEs, such as abundance in the genome, high sequence identity, and ability to move, make them major contributors to genomic instability [5, 27, 43].\n",
      "Recent studies have revealed the implications of TEs in genomic instability and human genome evolution [44].\n",
      "Mutations associated with TE insertions are well studied, and approximately 0.3% of all mutations are caused by retrotransposon insertions [27].\n",
      "Such insertions can be deleterious by disrupting the regulatory sequences of a gene.\n",
      "When a TE inserts within an exon, it may change the ORF, such that it codes for an aberrant peptide, or it may even cause missense or nonsense mutations.\n",
      "On the other hand, if it is inserted into an intronic region, it may cause an alternative splicing event by introducing novel splice sites, disrupting the canonical splice site, or introducing a polyadenylation signal [8, 9, 10, 11, 42, 43].\n",
      "In some instances, TE insertion into intronic regions can cause mRNA destabilization, thereby reducing gene expression [45].\n",
      "Similarly, some studies have suggested that TE insertion into the 5' or 3' region of a gene may alter its expression [46, 47, 48].\n",
      "Thus, such a change in gene expression may, in turn, change the equilibrium of regulatory networks and result in disease conditions (reviewed in Konkel and Batzer [43]).\n",
      "The currently active non-LTR transposons, L1, SVA, and Alu, are reported to be the causative factors of many genetic disorders, such as hemophilia, Apert syndrome, familial hypercholesterolemia, and colon and breast cancer (Table 1) [8, 10, 11, 27].\n",
      "Among the reported TE-mediated genetic disorders, X-linked diseases are more abundant than autosomal diseases [11, 27, 45], most of which are caused by L1 insertions.\n",
      "However, the phenomenon behind L1 and X-linked genetic disorders has not yet been revealed.\n",
      "The breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene, associated with breast and ovarian cancers, has been reported to be disrupted by multiple non-LTR TE insertions [9, 18, 49].\n",
      "There are some reports that the same location of a gene may undergo multiple insertions (e.g., Alu and L1 insertions in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene) (Table 1).\n",
      "It has also been proposed that inverted repeats are likely to be hotspots of genomic instability [50].\n",
      "Closely occurring Alu repeats form hairpin structures that are prone to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and excision [50, 51].\n",
      "In addition, de novo Alu insertions may create new inverted repeats that result in rearrangements in future generations [43].\n",
      "Due to the abundance of TEs in the human genome, the probability of TE-mediated NAHR translocations is high.\n",
      "Kolomietz et al.\n",
      "[52] reported that Alu elements are often found in and around the breakage points of translocations and result in diseases [53].\n",
      "Some studies have analyzed the human genome using the chimpanzee reference genome and found that deletions that are caused by Alu-mediated NAHRs are 9 times more frequent than L1-mediated NAHRs in the human genome [54, 55].\n",
      "Alu-mediated NAHRs are known to be associated with various genetic disorders and cancer (Table 1) [8, 10].\n",
      "L1 endonuclease creates abundant DSBs that are required for retrotransposition in mammalian cells and eventually contribute to genomic instability [56].\n",
      "However, it has been difficult to define this in an experimental condition, as physiological conditions cannot be simulated in vitro.\n",
      "Moreover, it is also difficult to distinguish DSBs caused by L1 from DSBs caused by other mechanisms in vivo [44, 56].\n",
      "From recent studies, it is apparent that the methylation state of DNA is associated with cancer [57].\n",
      "TEs-in particular, the promoters of L1 elements-are reported to be demethylated in cancer cells [58, 59].\n",
      "On the other hand, the methylation of retrotransposons is supposed to be a defense mechanism against retrotransposition in somatic cells [60].\n",
      "It has also been reported by some studies that the L1 transcription rate is increased in hypomethylated cancer cells [58, 61].\n",
      "Demethylation of TE promoters may result in their activation, which in turn could modify the TF level in the cell.\n",
      "It is possible that such changes in TF levels lead to alterations in global gene expression [57].\n",
      "In addition, demethylation may result in the activation of the L1 antisense promoter, which may eventually produce cancerassociated chimeric transcripts [62, 63].\n",
      "Taken together, the mechanisms discussed above have demonstrated the considerable impact of TEs on human genome evolution, genetic instability, and disease occurrence.\n",
      "There has been a recent increase in studies demonstrating the roles of TEs in multiple molecular processes.\n",
      "Importantly, several studies have found an association between TEs and cancer conditions.\n",
      "Technological developments have led to promising techniques (e.g., next-generation sequencing) that will assist researchers in studying, understanding, and confirming the role of TEs in genetic instability and diseases.\n",
      "Such progress may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the near future, such as personalized gene therapy for the treatment of genetic disorders.\n",
      "The clinical community has already realized the importance of personalized cancer treatments and is moving toward excellence in such treatment strategies.\n",
      "Therefore, we believe that in-depth studies on the role(s) of TEs in evolution, the epigenetic control of gene expression, and clinical aspects will be of paramount importance in uncovering novel mechanisms that can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "\n",
      "Besides single-nucleotide variants in the human genome, large-scale genomic variants, such as copy number variations (CNVs), are being increasingly discovered as a genetic source of human diversity and the pathogenic factors of diseases.\n",
      "Recent experimental findings have shed light on the links between different genome architectures and CNV mutagenesis.\n",
      "In this review, we summarize various genomic features and discuss their contributions to CNV formation.\n",
      "Genomic repeats, including both low-copy and high-copy repeats, play important roles in CNV instability, which was initially known as DNA recombination events.\n",
      "Furthermore, it has been found that human genomic repeats can also induce DNA replication errors and consequently result in CNV mutations.\n",
      "Some recent studies showed that DNA replication timing, which reflects the high-order information of genomic organization, is involved in human CNV mutations.\n",
      "Our review highlights that genome architecture, from DNA sequence to high-order genomic organization, is an important molecular factor in CNV mutagenesis and human genomic instability.\n",
      "Genetic mutations have been known as one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of human diseases.\n",
      "Besides the well-known single-nucleotide variants, it has been shown that the large-scale genomic variants also make a great contribution to human health.\n",
      "'Genomic disorders' are human diseases caused by relatively large genomic rearrangements [1].\n",
      "Such large-scale genomic variants (named copy number variation [CNV]) can also be frequent in human populations [2, 3].\n",
      "CNV involves DNA segments larger than 1 kb and exhibits variable copy numbers among individuals, comprising deletions and duplications/insertions [4, 5].\n",
      "In the past 10 years, CNV has been found to play an important role in both sporadic Mendelian disorders and complex diseases.\n",
      "Previous studies have reported that CNV can be mediated by multiple molecular mechanisms involving various genomic features.\n",
      "Here, we focus on CNV mutagenesis and review the involvement of human genome architecture in CNV instability and the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n",
      "Title: Genomic disorders and low-copy repeats\n",
      "\n",
      "Large-scale genomic changes in the human genome can be associated with human diseases.\n",
      "Such clinical conditions resulting from human genome architecture are termed 'genomic disorders' [1].\n",
      "The structural features, such as genomic repeats, can provide substrates for homologous recombination and induce genomic rearrangements and genomic disorders.\n",
      "Stankiewicz and Lupski [6] defined region-specific lowcopy repeats (LCRs) as paralogous genomic segments spanning 10-400 kb of genomic DNA and sharing ≥95%-97% sequence identity.\n",
      "The non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between directly oriented LCRs can generate microdeletions and microduplications of megabases in size, which are frequently associated with genomic disorders (Fig.1).\n",
      "For example, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a well-investigated disorder caused by microdeletions between the paired LCRs in human 22q11.2, which deletes one copy of TBX1, CRKL, MAPK1, and several additional genes [7, 8, 9, 10].\n",
      "In addition to microdeletions, microduplications can also manifest as genomic disorders.\n",
      "The 1.4-Mb microduplication involving the PMP22 gene in human 17p12 can lead to CMT1A, which is a classical model for disease resulting from gene dosage effects [11, 12].\n",

      "\n",
      "Genomic repeats play a significant role in human evolution and have a strong association with genomic CNVs [6, 13, 14, 15].\n",
      "In 2001, Eichler [16] initially conducted a systematically bioinformatic analysis for such low-copy genomic repeats and defined them as segmental duplications (SDs), which have a high degree of sequence identity (>90%-95%) and large genomic sizes (1-100 kb).\n",
      "After that, Bailey et al.\n",
      "[17] further performed a whole-genome assembly comparison to detect SDs with pair-wise alignments ≥ 90% and ≥ 1 kb in the human genome.\n",
      "In addition to human SDs, the subsequent analyses also identified the SD architecture in the genomes of other primates, including chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, and even in the mouse genome [17, 18, 19, 20], all of which have been archived in the online database of the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).\n",
      "LCR/SD is a very important category of DNA architecture in the human genome.\n",
      "It has been found that they are associated with duplicated genes and pseudogenes [21], co-localize and overlap with Alu elements and CNV [22, 23], and play an important role in genome evolution [24, 25, 26].\n",
      "LCR/SD pairs, acting as substrates, are thought to be a key factor in triggering NAHR events and causing CNV mutations [4, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].\n",
      "Generally, reversely oriented SDs can align and subsequently crossover with each other via NAHR, resulting in copy-neutral inversions of the flanking DNA fragments (Fig.1A).\n",
      "Similarly, NAHR events between direct SD pairs can cause CNVs.\n",
      "Based on the different positions of SD pairs, different types of CNVs occur.\n",
      "Duplications or deletions take place in NAHR events between different chromatids (interchromatid) (Fig.1B), while only deletions occur in NAHR on the same chromatid (intra-chromatid) (Fig.1C).\n",
      "Based on the observations in specific pathogenic loci, SD properties (including homology length, distance, and sequence similarity) were shown to affect the incidence of NAHR [33].\n",
      "In a recent study on common CNVs in human populations, it was found that SD length and inter-SD distance were the major SD properties involved in NAHR frequency [34].\n",
      "A model of chromosomal compression/extension/looping has also been proposed for homology mispairing in NAHR [34].\n",
      "Title: High-copy repeats in CNV instability\n",
      "\n",
      "The genomic repeats representing DNA primary structures can be divided into LCR/SD and high-copy repeats.\n",
      "Compared to LCR/SD, high-copy repeats constitute a great portion of the human genome.\n",
      "Interspersed repeats are the most common type of high-copy repeats, which cover over 44% of the human genome [35].\n",
      "One of the major classes of interspersed repeats is the retrotransposon, including short interspersed elements (SINEs), long interspersed elements (LINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).\n",
      "SINEs are short DNA sequences (100-400 bp in length) with an internal (mobile) polymerase III promoter [15], making up about 11% of the human genome [36].\n",
      "The most common SINEs are Alu elements, which burst out in the evolution of primates [37].\n",
      "Moreover, Alu elements play an important role in disease, such as breast cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, familial hypercholesterolemia, and so on [38].\n",
      "In 2008, Kim et al.\n",
      "[22] found a strong association between Alu elements and old SDs.\n",
      "By means of NAHR, Alu elements contribute to the formation of CNVs, especially deletions [39, 40, 41, 42, 43].\n",
      "The most classic repeats in LINEs are the LINE-1 (L1) elements, which are 6-8 kb in length [44].\n",
      "Covering about 17% of the human genome, L1 elements can elevate genomic instability, provide resources for NAHR [39, 40, 41, 45, 46], and cause human diseases [47, 48, 49, 50].\n",
      "In the human genome, there exist at least 50,000 copies of ERVs [51], which are defined as human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), covering about 4.9% of human DNA sequences [21].\n",
      "Via the NAHR mechanism, HERVs were found to induce large deletions and cause hypotonia and motor, language, and cognitive delays [52, 53].\n",
      "Intriguingly, a series of studies show that there is a strong association between HERVs and CNVs in the region of AZFa, a well-known locus related to male infertility [54, 55, 56, 57].\n",
      "As discussed above, repeat-mediated NAHR is one of the major mutational mechanisms for CNV formations.\n",
      "In these recombination-based events, paired repeats in direct orientation contribute to CNV instability and disease traits.\n",
      "However, is it the only way for the genomic repeats to induce CNV mutations?\n",

      "IRs, sharing high sequence similarity in adjacent loci, are found to align or crossover with each other and form specific DNA secondary structures, such as cruciform structures, during DNA replication [58].\n",
      "Formation of such secondary structures can cause DNA replication fork stalling, and later, jumping into the wrong locus to continue replicating (Fig.2).\n",
      "This mechanism of triggering replication errors subsequently results in genomic rearrangements and CNV mutations [24].\n",
      "Title: IRs induce complex CNVs by replication errors\n",

      "During DNA replication, IRs could form DNA secondary structures, which will induce replication fork stalling.\n",
      "Template switching and replication resumption further result in CNV mutations (Fig.2).\n",
      "Notably, replication-associated events usually lead to complex CNVs, which include the combined segments of deletions and duplications.\n",
      "As was reported, Chen et al.\n",

      "SCs are short in length (91% of which range from 150 bp to 1 kb in size) [14].\n",
      "Furthermore, SCs have a limited number of matched alignments in the human genome.\n",

      "DNA replication takes place at replication forks following a fixed way [70].\n",
      "In the human genome, the segments of chromosomes replicate in a temporal order [71], and the whole genome is spatially segregated by replication zones of different organizations.\n",
      "With some replicons in one spatial compartmentalization of chromatin fired synchronously, this chromosomal unit shares the same replication timing, termed the 'replication domain.'\n",
      "Therefore, the genome consists of several replication domains with different replication timing and the timing transition regions.\n",
      "Replication timing can be measured by two distinct methods, based on current genome technologies [72, 73, 74].\n",
      "One method is to label the newly replicated DNA with chemically tagged nucleotides.\n",
      "Then, the DNA will be isolated from cells at various times during S phase by immune-precipitation or density fractionation.\n",
      "In the other method, since DNA segments that replicate earlier accumulate more copies than those that replicate late in most cells-the DNA content of a region simply reflects the replication timing.\n",
      "After being classified by florescence-activated cell sorting, the DNAs extracted from S phase and G1 phase cells, respectively, are compared by next-generation sequencing or microarray technologies.\n",
      "By either way, a replication timing profile can be generated (Fig.3) [75].\n",
      "Based on the timing profiles, a lot of progress has been made on understanding the replication program and its relationship with other genome architectures.\n",
      "Recent findings indicate significant links between replication timing and the features of primary genomic structures [76].\n",
      "The genomic regions where DNA replicates earlier usually have more genes, fewer LINEs, and higher GC content [77, 78].\n",
      "Moreover, it is noticed that DNA replication timing correlates with transcription [79, 80, 81].\n",
      "Expressed genes replicate earlier, while repressed genes replicate late.\n",
      "Although this correlation shows a discrepancy between multicellular and single-celled organisms, it is worth noting that such works indeed reveal the striking association of replication timing and transcriptional activity in humans [77, 82, 83].\n",
      "Moreover, recent findings show that replication timing strongly correlates with three-dimensional chromatin structures [84].\n",
      "In Hi-C data, it has been observed that chromatin is organized into two separate compartments.\n",
      "Remarkably, DNA that resides in close spatial structures replicates in near time, and chromatin that interacts between two compartments is exactly at the timing transition regions.\n",

      "This phenomenon exists in not only cancer but also noncancerous cells [88, 89, 90].\n",
      "This abnormal replication program apparently has a notable impact on genomic stability and thus increases the frequency of chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs.\n",
      "Recent findings have indicated that aberrant DNA replication timing is involved in changes in gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and an increased CNV mutation frequency [91, 92].\n",
      "An analysis of 331,724 somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) has shown that SCNAs increase in late-replicating regions among cells of different cancer types.\n",

      "\n",
      "Recent technical advances, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarrays (ChIp-chip) and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq), have generated large quantities of high-throughput data.\n",
      "Considering that epigenomic datasets are arranged over chromosomes, their analysis must account for spatial or temporal characteristics.\n",
      "In that sense, simple clustering or classification methodologies are inadequate for the analysis of multi-track ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq data.\n",
      "Approaches that are based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) can integrate dependencies between directly adjacent measurements in the genome.\n",
      "Here, we review three HMM-based studies that have contributed to epigenetic research, from a computational perspective.\n",
      "We also give a brief tutorial on HMM modelling-targeted at bioinformaticians who are new to the field.\n",
      "Many researchers have shown that formal language theory is an appropriate tool in analyzing various biological sequences [1, 2].\n",
      "The hidden Markov model (HMM) is most closely related to regular grammars, because an n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence, and language models that are built from n-grams are actually (n-1)-order Markov models.\n",
      "However, the research of modeling biological sequences has usually focused on nucleotide or amino acid sequences that encode RNA or interact with proteins [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].\n",
      "On the other hand, noncoding DNA regions, which occupy approximately 98% of human DNA, have not been considered for HMM-based analysis.\n",
      "The reason is partially due to the fact that a large proportion of noncoding DNA has been believed to have no known biological functions.\n",
      "However, recent technical advances, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq), formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) [13, 14], and computational epigenetics, have started to convert unannotated noncoding DNA into highly annotated functional areas [15, 16].\n",
      "The work is analogous to dissecting the region that constitutes the noncoding DNA and understanding the type of meaning each element contains.\n",
      "For this reason, the field of epigenetics has received a boost of attention and is currently among the fastest moving areas in molecular biology.\n",
      "However, epigenetic mechanisms are highly interwoven in a complex network of interactions.\n",
      "Disentangling this network is an important goal of epigenetic research.\n",
      "Thus, various bioinformatic challenges arise from the analysis of epigenetic data, and HMMs have played a significant role in solving important epigenetic problems, as HMMs are well suited to the task of discovering unobserved 'hidden' states from 'observed' sequences in their spatial genomic context.\n",
      "In this paper, we give a tutorial review of the design of HMMs and their applications to solve various computational epigenetic problems.\n",
      "We selected three representative works to compare different designs of HMMs for various computational epigenetic problems: the Li et al.\n",

      "[18] three-hidden-state HMM to compare histone modification sites, and the Ernst and Kellis [19] multi-state multivariate HMM to analyze systematic state dynamics of human cells.\n",
      "We want to clarify the fact that this review is by no means exhaustive and that there exist many other types of HMMs for computational epigenetic problems.\n",

      "To explain the difference, let us consider a simple example.\n",
      "Suppose that adjacent regions of genomic sequences are divided into multiple 10-bp bins (though unrealistic), as in Fig.1, in which some kinds of chromatin marks or methylation profiles are annotated.\n",
      "Suppose also that we define two imaginary methylated states, 'M' (in green color) and 'U' (in orange color), based on some kinds of epigenetic profiles.\n",

      "An HMM is usually visualized as a directed graph with vertices corresponding to the states and the edges representing pairs of states with transition probability aij and emission probability ei(j), as in Fig.2.\n",
      "The graph defines the topology of the model, while the emission and the transition probabilities define the parameters of the model.\n",
      "The given HMM tries to capture the statistical differences in the two hidden states of 'M' and 'U.'\n",

      "The probability of starting from M and U is 60% and 40%, respectively.\n",
      "M and U use different sets of emission probabilities to reflect the symbol statistics.\n",

      "\n",
      "In November 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to 23andMe, Inc. and ordered the company to discontinue marketing of the 23andMe Personal Genome Service (PGS) until it receives FDA marketing authorization for the device.\n",
      "The FDA considers the PGS as an unclassified medical device, which requires premarket approval or de novo classification.\n",
      "Opponents of the FDA's action expressed their concerns, saying that the FDA is overcautious and paternalistic, which violates consumers' rights and might stifle the consumer genomics field itself, and insisted that the agency should not restrict direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic testing without empirical evidence of harm.\n",
      "Proponents support the agency's action as protection of consumers from potentially invalid and almost useless information.\n",
      "This action was also significant, since it reflected the FDA's attitude towards medical application of next-generation sequencing techniques.\n",
      "In this review, we followed up on the FDA-23andMe incident and evaluated the problems and prospects for DTC genetic testing.\n",
      "On November 22, 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to Ann Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of 23andMe, Inc. and ordered the company to \"immediately discontinue marketing of the 23andMe Saliva Collection Kit and Personal Genome Service (PGS) until such time as it receives FDA marketing authorization for the device\" [1].\n",
      "Since 23andMe is one of the largest direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies leading the field, the FDA's action could have big implications for the present and future.\n",
      "This FDA letter was even called a \"bombshell\" in one Nature Editorial [2].\n",
      "Various responses and speculation have followed.\n",
      "Some people support the FDA's action as protection of consumers from potentially invalid information, while others insist that the FDA's action violates the rights of individuals to receive information and of 'commercial speech' and undermines democratization of health care and patient empowerment [3].\n",
      "One of those responses is noteworthy: 7 months after the FDA's action, in June 2014, Lee and Lee [4] of the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) submitted a report to the Public-Private Joint Regulatory Advancement Initiative (PPJRAI), titled \"Market Analysis and Strategies for Regulatory Reform in Medical Industry,\" which expressed a stance somehow different from that of the US FDA.\n",
      "To facilitate the discussion in our scientific community, we examined the development of the 23andMe event and reflected on the future of genetic-genome testing, including whole-genome sequencing as a medical device.\n",
      "DTC genetic testing, also known as at-home genetic testing, refers to genetic tests that are sold directly to consumers via the internet, television, or print advertisement without necessarily involving health care providers.\n",
      "Su [5] grouped the reasons for using DTC genetic tests into three categories; identity (such as ancestry, paternity, or ethnicity)-seeking; disease risk-testing to complement health care; and curiosity-driven testing.\n",
      "DTC genetic testing has its pros and cons.\n",
      "It is more accessible and affordable than traditional genetic tests, which usually target one specific gene at a time.\n",
      "DTC testing companies and many personalized medicine advocates argue that knowing the genetic risks for potential diseases will help people to improve their health and wellness by changing what they can and managing what they can not, as claimed in 23andMe's TV commercial [6].\n",
      "23andMe, one of the largest DTC genetic testing companies, also made the same claims and has offered the PGS to >475,000 customers since 2007 [7].\n",
      "23andMe's PGS genotypes the DNA sample on their custom single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip and provides health reports on 254 diseases and traits, including carrier status and drug response, which, the company claims, enables customers to personalize their health care.\n",
      "Additionally, some proponents suggest, as another argument, that DTC genetic testing can contribute to the empowerment of consumers by increasing knowledge and to subsequent democratization of health care [5].\n",
      "However, many geneticists and physicians have rejected the claims.\n",
      "They believe that since DTC genetic testing is not reliable enough to be used clinically, it will just end up increasing health care costs unnecessarily [8].\n",
      "Apart from its scientific weaknesses and insufficient clinical utility, there are other concerns raised by critics, including psychological and financial damage to consumers, especially by unreliable test results, health care inequity, and genetic privacy.\n",
      "Since we believe that scientific validity is the foremost foundation of DTC genetic testing and should presuppose its clinical usage, we will focus on it in this review.\n",
      "There are quite a few scientific limitations to genome-based health risk estimation services in general, not just 23andMe's PGS, but they may not be apparent, even to medical professionals, who do not have enough knowledge in genetics and genomics, as well as lay customers.\n",
      "First of all, for monogenic disorders, DTC genetic testing panels include a small fraction of known disease-causing mutations or sometimes just include mutations present only in specific populations.\n",
      "This incompleteness of testing results in misinterpretations, which makes its clinical value doubtful.\n",
      "Also, for polygenicmultifactorial disorders and conditions, DTC testing panels include only a small percentage of the markers among many known associated markers, not to mention unknown ones, which also makes the risk prediction incomplete and, as a result, inaccurate.\n",
      "We also should not forget that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are not taken into consideration for risk estimation at all.\n",
      "In addition, it is hard to say that their algorithms for estimating total combined risks are very well validated.\n",
      "In summary, genome-based DTC tests are incomplete, and the interpretation of their results is hardly valid.\n",
      "The biology is much more complicated than some health care entrepreneurs believe, and genotypes and sequences are not information but are just basic tools to use for understanding biology.\n",
      "Even in the case of valid associations that have been replicated by many studies, the effect sizes of most SNPs on specific diseases seem to be small to modest [9].\n",
      "Secondly, even though their customers are provided detailed background information on the method used for genotyping and the statistical interpretation, which supposedly helps their understanding, there is still ample possibility for misconceptions.\n",
      "Some professional societies have issued statements on DTC genetic testing.\n",
      "The American College of Medicine Genetics said, in their 2003 statement, that due to the complexities of testing and counseling, patients' use of DTC genetic testing kits may pose harms, which include the following: test utilization for inappropriate purposes, misinterpretation of test results, and lack of necessary follow-up [10].\n",
      "In 2007, the American Society of Human Genetics also expressed their concerns in a statement on DTC genetic testing, saying that consumers are at risk of harm if the quality of tests is not high enough-i.e., the analytical or clinical validity and clinical utility of tests are not appropriate [11].\n",
      "Analytical validity shows how accurately and reliably the test detects a specific genetic variant.\n",
      "Clinical validity shows how well the genetic variant is related to the existence or risk of a specific disease or condition.\n",
      "Clinical utility shows how likely the test can improve patient outcomes [12].\n",
      "Consumers are also at risk of harm if claims made about tests are misleading or simply false and if information and counseling are not properly provided to enable the consumer to make an informed decision about whether to take the test or not and about what actions to take after the genetic test [11].\n",
      "Due to these criticisms and repeated interventions from regulators, including the US FDA, especially in the United States, the DTC market does not look very promising at this moment.\n",
      "Even one Nature Editorial said that DTC genetic testing is not yet a viable business model, and most firms in the market have stopped providing services involved with personal disease risk estimation or have even totally shut down [2].\n",
      "On November 22, 2013, the US FDA sent a warning letter to 23andMe, Inc. and ordered the company to immediately cease marketing of their Saliva Collection Kit and PGS until it received proper marketing authorization for the device [1].\n",
      "This letter was sent after the firm failed to provide additional information on the analytical and clinical validity of the PGS the FDA requested.\n",
      "It said that although the FDA has been diligently working to help the company comply with regulatory requirements since July 2009, it stopped communicating with the FDA since May.\n",
      "Apparently making matters worse, the company initiated new marketing campaigns, including TV commercials.\n",
      "This made the FDA conclude that the company intends to expand the PGS's uses and consumer base without obtaining marketing authorization from the agency [2].\n",
      "The FDA clearly stated that their PGS requires marketing approval, because it is intended for use \"in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body.\"\n",
      "In other words, the FDA considers the PGS an unclassified medical device, which requires premarket approval or de novo classification [1].\n",
      "After receiving the letter, on November 26, 2014, Wojcicki acknowledged in a blog post that they were behind schedule with their responses to the FDA and that the agency needs to be convinced of the quality of their PGS data.\n",
      "On December 5, 2013, the company announced that it would suspend its health-related genetic tests to comply with the US FDA's directive during the regulatory review process [13].\n",
      "Based on the letter, the FDA does not seem to think that the analytical validity of 23andMe's SNP genotyping is a problem per se as far as its results are correct but feels that the clinical validity of risk estimation has yet to be validated, which may be practically impossible.\n",
      "After that, 23andMe announced that it has been working with the FDA, and the agency seemed to consider the firm's response to be adequate [14].\n",
      "However, the firm is not able to provide any timeline for resuming their PGS.\n",
      "The US FDA's action evoked mixed reactions.\n",
      "Some expressed their concerns, saying that the FDA is overcautious and paternalistic and hinders medical advances.\n",
      "According to Green and Farahany [3], the FDA's action violates the rights of individuals to receive information and of 'commercial speech' and undermines the democratization of health care and patient empowerment.\n",
      "Also, they were concerned that this kind of overcautious regulation might stifle the consumer genomics field itself and insisted that the agency should not restrict DTC genomic testing without empirical evidence of harm.\n",
      "However, rather ironically, they ended up emphasizing the PGS's poor clinical utility by saying that health-related interpretations of the PGS, particularly about common genetic variants, relate only indirectly to preventing or diagnosing disease [4].\n",
      "If their comment is true, what is the point of taking the test?\n",
      "It is simply not ethical to entice people to pay for useless products.\n",
      "One non-profit technology policy think tank, called TechFreedom, launched an online petition asking the FDA to reverse the ban and collected a total of 10,073 signatures on January 18, 2014 [15].\n",
      "Many petitioners said that their genetic codes belong to them, so they have the \"right to know\" what is written there, and that the assumption that they should be \"protected from knowing\" because they are not smart enough to understand is simply insulting.\n",
      "All of these concerns are understandable, but we insist that genetic testing with scientific flaws itself is a great harm to consumers and that those flaws need to be addressed before discussing the protection of anyone's right to know or not to know.\n",
      "Of course, there are many people who support the FDA's action as protection of consumers from potentially invalid and almost useless information.\n",
      "Among the professional proponents, Baudhuin emphatically wrote in her opinion paper that if it is too burdensome to prove the validity of the information that the DTC testing companies offer, they should not sell the information in the first place [2].\n",
      "Some consumers are already initiating procedures for class-action lawsuits against 23andMe, claiming that it is selling misleading information [2].\n",
      "On November 27, 2013, just 5 days after the FDA's warning letter was sent to 23andMe, the first class-action lawsuit was already filed in the Southern District Court of California [16].\n",
      "However, even among the supporters, some people saw the FDA's action as rather unusual, because the decision was largely based on its theoretical harm rather than actual harm, which the FDA has usually been waiting for before acting.\n",
      "In Korea, Lee and Lee [4] of the KHIDI submitted a report in June 2014 to the PPJRAI, titled \"Market Analysis and Strategies for Regulatory Reform in Medical Industry,\" which expressed a stance somehow different from that of the US FDA [4].\n",
      "In this report, they suggested that it will help to expand the PGS market if genetic testing agencies are exempted from providing at least two scientific reports to support or prove the clinical validity of their tests when they make a notification of their testing items for disease prevention to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention [4].\n",
      "This recommendation seems to be in opposition to the US FDA's.\n",
      "Also, they recommended an amendment to the Bioethics and Safety Act, which will allow non-medical institutions, such as biotechnology companies, to perform health-related PGSs, at least for disease prediction and prevention (not diagnosis) [4].\n",
      "However, they added that this predictive, preventive genetic testing should be performed under the supervision of physicians, like the US FDA insists.\n",
      "Since these recommendations are supposed be delivered to the ministries involved in regulating genetic testing, we may guess which direction our governmental regulation system will take in the near future.\n",
      "23andMe is now working to get FDA approval for its health tests; the company submitted seven health-related tests to the FDA for review in July 2014; it plans to submit 100 additional tests before the end of the year [17].\n",
      "However, it is very likely that this process will take years.\n",
      "However, they have been trying different strategies, including finding new markets.\n",
      "From October 2014, 23andMe has begun selling its health-related genetic tests in Canada, despite still being blocked by the US FDA from offering its health risk-related service [18].\n",
      "Downing and Ross wrote that sales of DTC genetic tests, including 23andMe's PGS, could be resumed only if reliable data have been accumulated that can demonstrate that the tests have positive clinical validity and can be used safely without professional supervision [19].\n",
      "As we mentioned above, this task is easier said than done-it can be practically impossible.\n",
      "Even the same authors actually emphasized the importance of the physician's role in the same article, which can \"contextualize\" test results for maximizing clinical benefit, preventing adverse effects, and genuinely empowering patients [19].\n",
      "Zettler et al.\n",
      "[20] wrote that the FDA's warning to 23andMe may effectively mark the end of the DTC genetic testing field, at least in the United States, if 23andMe's PGS cannot meet the FDA's standards for clinical validity.\n",
      "DTC genetic testing companies, such as Navigenics and deCODEme, were already sold to other firms and stopped their health-related services in 2012 [20].\n",
      "The problem is that no one knows, at the moment, how strict the FDA's standards for clinical validity will be.\n",
      "Title: Another question will definitely be this: what will happen to whole-genome and exome sequencing, which is already replacing single-gene tests or SNP chips, in terms of clinical application?\n",
      "Interestingly, just 3 days before warning 23andMe, the FDA authorized Illumina to market four \"next-generation\" gene sequencing devices: a sequencing platform, two assays-the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis 139-Variant Assay and MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Sequencing Assay-and a \"universal kit\" that allows laboratories that purchase the platform to develop and validate sequencing of any part of a patient's genome and to find any differences between the patient and the reference [21].\n",
      "What made the difference in the fate of these two companies?\n",
      "We have not made an inquiry about this directly to the US FDA but can get some clues from the FDA's press release about this authorization.\n",
      "First of all, it said that these assays will check \"specific points in the patient's CFTR gene sequence\" to detect known and unknown variants.\n",
      "Their reports will include the existence of genetic variants in the gene sequence that are known to be associated with one specific disease but will not provide medical interpretations of the findings.\n",
      "Second, it did not mention non-patient customers at all.\n",
      "Finally, the press release also emphasized the clinician's involvement.\n",
      "It said that \"this information-rich technology is becoming more accessible for use by physicians in the care of their patients\" and that \"the new technology also gives physicians the ability to take a broader look at their patients' genetic makeup and can help in diagnosing disease or identifying the cause of symptoms\" [21].\n",
      "We believe that the US FDA's authorization of the MiSeqDX for cystic fibrosis reflects the agency's attitude towards any tests involving the human genome.\n",
      "Therefore, from this, we can guess the answer to the question we posed above: any genetic/genome/exome tests will be required to prove their analytical and clinical validity and clinical utility for specific diseases and conditions if they are intended for medical applications.\n",
      "Until then, we suggest that their application should be restricted to research applications and family studies for diagnosing genetic disorders of unknown etiology.\n",
      "When a human being is involved, we believe that the most important ethics principle is \"Do no harm.\"\n",

      "Despite its high occurrence, the exact molecular mechanisms of the development and progression are not fully understood.\n",
      "The existing cancer therapy based on allopathic medicine is expensive, exhibits side effects; and may also alter the normal functioning of genes.\n",
      "Thus, a non-toxic and effective mode of treatment is needed to control cancer development and progression.\n",
      "Some medicinal plants offer a safe, effective and affordable remedy to control the cancer progression.\n",
      "Nimbolide, a limnoid derived from the neem (Azadirachta indica) leaves and flowers of neem, is widely used in traditional medical practices for treating various human diseases.\n",
      "Nimbolide exhibits several pharmacological effects among which its anticancer activity is the most promising.\n",
      "The previous studies carried out over the decades have shown that nimbolide inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells.\n",
      "This review highlights the current knowledge on the molecular targets that contribute to the observed anticancer activity of nimbolide related to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest; and inhibition of signaling pathways related to cancer progression.\n",
      "Cancer is the most dangerous disease of human and a major health problem worldwide [1].\n",
      "Preclinical studies have shown that cancer is a large group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled cell growth and spread of abnormal cells.\n",
      "Over the past quarter of a century, an outstanding progress in understanding of the proteins involved in cancer progression has grown, providing chances for identifying new targets for anti-cancer therapy [2, 3].\n",
      "Present modes of treatment based on synthetic drugs have limited potential, because they are toxic and expensive and also alter cell signaling pathways.\n",
      "Natural drugs that are safe, affordable, and effective are needed to control cancer development and progression.\n",
      "Natural products have been used for thousands of years in the management of several diseases including various types of cancer [4].\n",
      "Nimbolide was first derived from the leaves and flowers of neem.\n",
      "Neem (Azadirachta indica), is a traditional medicinal plant of the Meliaceae family widely distributed in Asia, Africa and other tropical parts of the world.\n",
      "All parts of the neem tree offer amazing potential for medicinal, agricultural and industrial exploitation and have been evaluated for antiinflammatory, antipyretic, antihistamine, antifungal, antitubercular, antiprotozoal, vasodilatory, antimalarial, diuretic, spermicidal, antiarthritic, insect repellent, antifeedant, and antihormonal activities [5].\n",
      "Studies of extracts from all major parts of neem plant including the leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, have shown promising chemopreventive and therapeutic effects in pre-clinical research [6].\n",
      "Extracts of neem leaf have been reported to be non-toxic and non-mutagenic and are found to possess immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties [7].\n",
      "There are many studies showing the ethanolic extract of neem leaves to possess anticancer activity.\n",
      "Ethanolic neem leaf extract (ENLE) exhibited anticancer activity against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced oxidative stress and gastric carcinogenesis [8].\n",
      "ENLE induces apoptosis in a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreasing the level of Bcl-2 protein resulting in DNA fragmentation in prostate cancer cells [9, 10].\n",

      "It is the major component of the leaves of A. indica.\n",
      "Nimbolide (5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-diprenylflavanone), is a tetranortriterpenoid with a, β-unsaturated system and δ-lactonic ring (Fig.1) [11].\n",
      "It has been shown to exhibit numerous types of biological activities, including, anti-malarial [12], anti-bacterial activity [13], anti-feedent, [14] and anticancer activities [15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\n",
      "Literature evidence reveals that α, β-unsaturated ketone structural element is responsible for the anticancer activity of nimbolide [20, 21].\n",
      "Cancers are abnormal cell growth caused by genomic modification.\n",
      "So, any agent that has anti-cancer activity either protects genetic material from alterations or kills the genetically altered cancer cells.\n",
      "The active component nimbolide from neem acts on cancer cells and kill them by altering the several molecular pathways.\n",
      "The cytotoxicity of nimbolide has been widely studied over the last several years in a large variety of cancer cell lines [22].\n",
      "It was reported recently that nimbolide inhibited cancer progression by influencing multiple mechanisms, including prevention of procarcinogen activation and oxidative DNA damage, upregulation of antioxidant and induction of apoptosis, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis [19, 23, 24, 25, 26].\n",
      "The potential mechanisms of cancer prevention by nimbolide are described below and summarized in Fig.2.\n",
      "Tumorigenesis and cancer progression are thought to be the result of some changes in different types of genetic pathways [27, 28].\n",
      "Nimbolide, a chief constituent of neem, shows a vital role in cancer prevention and treatment through the modulation of various biological activities, including molecular cascades.\n",

      "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is involved in the proliferation, survival, and migration of tumor cells.\n",
      "IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in about 70% of breast cancers [31, 32].\n",
      "It is established that the consequences of IGF-IR activation by its ligands result in the recruitment of major adapter signaling proteins, such as src/collagen homology proteins, which lead to interaction with Grb2/Sos [33].\n",
      "Recruitment of these molecules activates two distinct signal transduction pathways.\n",
      "One pathway activates Ras, Raf, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in the transcription of genes that drive proliferation, and the other pathway involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which are responsible for cell survival and anti-apoptotic signal transduction [34].\n",
      "Downregulation of these molecules will give rise to inhibition of cell survival, invasion, and induction of apoptosis.\n",
      "Aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt signaling has been associated with the development and progression of many cancers [35], making this pathway an attractive target for therapeutic strategies.\n",
      "The increase in p-Akt level in breast tumor samples correlates with a poor prognosis [36, 37] and predicts a worse outcome among endocrine-treated patients [38].\n",
      "The major inhibitor of Akt is the dual-specificity protein and lipid phosphatase, phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) that counteracts the PI3K-dependent Akt activation by dephosphorylating the D3 position of PIP3 [39].\n",
      "PTEN activity is frequently lost by mutations, deletions or promoter methylation silencing in many primary and metastatic human cancers [40, 41].\n",
      "The inhibition of PI3K/Akt and activation of the PTEN pathway constitute a good strategy in the prevention of cancer.\n",
      "The recent findings of Karkare et al.\n",
      "[42] proved that nimbolide suppresses glioblastoma viability and detains tumor growth by inhibiting CDK4/6 activity, leading to retinoblastoma hypophosphorylation and cell cycle arrest and by inhibiting growth factor pathways that are hyperactivated in glioblastoma, including the PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways [42].\n",

      "The haplotype block ranges from bp 182065282 through bp 182065351; the length of the haplotype is 69 bp.\n",
      "Since there are four SNPs, the average space is about 17.\n",
      "We plotted the distribution of the average spaces between SNPs within a haplotype (Fig.2).\n",
      "The number of alleles found for a haplotype is also plotted in Fig.2.\n",
      "The GWAS is a powerful method to identify genomic variants affecting traits.\n",
      "Many studies have found important SNPs associated with diseases.\n",
      "However, the study is not well suited to identify rare variants or small effects of several SNPs [18].\n",
      "Here, we tried to find haplotype blocks in 7 Korea individuals that harbor SNPs that are significantly associated with BMI in a Korean population.\n",
      "The significant SNPs for BMI were detected through GWASs, and the haplotypes were discovered by analyzing the NGS data.\n",
      "We selected short reads within the LD ranges that encompassed the significant SNPs from the GWAS results, and the heterozygous variants that were called from those reads were phased, based on the paired-end information.\n",
      "As a result, we detected 44 haplotype blocks harboring SNPs that are significantly associated with BMI in Koreans.\n",
      "The haplotypes may affect BMI in Korea individuals.\n",
      "However, it is not statically powerful, due to the small number of samples (7 individuals) used in this study.\n",
      "Actually, the alleles of a haplotype need to be compared with those of the haplotype of the same range in other individuals to have high accuracy.\n",
      "We could not follow this strategy.\n",
      "For example, most of the haplotypes found by this analysis were discovered in a single individual.\n",
      "In our small dataset, a significant SNP from a GWAS is not likely to be shared by several individuals, because many SNPs have a minor allele frequency of around 10% in a population.\n",
      "This problem may be solved if a large dataset is used.\n",
      "In addition, read depth also reduces accuracy.\n",
      "In Table 2, several haplotypes were identified in a single GWA LD block.\n",
      "These haplotypes could not be joined, as there were not enough short reads that could bridge them using the phase function in Samtools.\n",
      "In addition, AK7 has the GATX haplotype at bps 57903745, 57904011 (rs590654), 57904088 (rs590215), and 57907787 in chromosome 18, and AK4 has XAXC in the same locus.\n",

      "In Table 2, the green letters represent such alleles that have been filtered by read depth and recovered manually.\n",
      "Although the accuracy is not high, this integrative method has several advantages.\n",
      "First, rare variants can be detected.\n",
      "For example, AK4 has the TT risk allele haplotype at bps 57895600 and 57900630 in chromosome 18.\n",
      "The former was associated with BMI and was registered in the dbSNP database, while the latter was not registered in the dbSNP database.\n",
      "Bp 57900630 is possibly a low-frequency risk allele, which is difficult to be detected by GWAS.\n",
      "Second, we can explain a trait systematically.\n",
      "rs559623 is an SNP (C/A: forward strand) that is associated with BMI.\n",
      "It may act with bp 57844375 in chromosome 18 as CC according to our results (Table 2).\n",
      "Traits can be explained properly by multiple variants.\n",
      "Finally, this method is useful for studying phasing.\n",
      "Many SNPs from an array or NGS reads are unphased genotypes.\n",
      "However, the bulk of SNP information needs to be phased for identifying co-located alleles.\n",
      "While GATK HaplotypeCaller, Samtools Phase, and Beagle are used to phase variants, there are several problems, such as the long execution time and the need for large system memory.\n",
      "In fact, it takes too long to phase entire chromosomes or a single chromosome.\n",
      "However, with this method, it is possible to analyze efficiently with regard to time and memory, as it does not consider reference and genotype data of the entire chromosome.\n",
      "This method focuses only on the data within regions that are nearby important variants from the GWA analysis results.\n",

      "Moreover, TSG expression may cause gene silencing through the hypermethylation of CGIs, and such a paradigm opens up a new avenue of cancer diagnosis and treatment based on DNA methylation profiles [4].\n",
      "In cancer cells, genes that play important roles in cell growth and differentiation, such as TSG, DNA repair genes, and apoptosis-related genes, show downregulation in expression due to hypermethylation in their promoter regions.\n",
      "For example, the expression of p16, a well-known TSG, is downregulated due to its promoter hypermethylation [5], and DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1 and hMLH1, are also hypermethylated, repressing their gene expression [6].\n",
      "It appears that hypermethylation profiles in CGIs may be useful targets for cancer treatment.\n",
      "Some DNA methylation inhibitors have been used as anticancer agents, paving a new avenue for the development of anticancer therapeutics [7].\n",

      "Genome-wide association studies have proven the highly polygenic architecture of complex diseases or traits; therefore, single-locus-based methods are usually unable to detect all involved loci, especially when individual loci exert small effects.\n",
      "Moreover, the majority of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms resides in non-coding regions, making it difficult to understand their phenotypic contribution.\n",
      "In this work, we studied epistatic interactions associated with three common diseases using Korea Association Resource (KARE) data: type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and coronary artery disease (CAD).\n",
      "We showed that epistatic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were enriched in enhancers, as well as in DNase I footprints (the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements [ENCODE] Project Consortium 2012), which suggested that the disruption of the regulatory regions where transcription factors bind may be involved in the disease mechanism.\n",
      "Accordingly, to identify the genes affected by the SNPs, we employed whole-genome multiple-cell-type enhancer data which discovered using DNase I profiles and Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE).\n",
      "Assigned genes were significantly enriched in known disease associated gene sets, which were explored based on the literature, suggesting that this approach is useful for detecting relevant affected genes.\n",
      "In our knowledge-based epistatic network, the three diseases share many associated genes and are also closely related with each other through many epistatic interactions.\n",
      "These findings elucidate the genetic basis of the close relationship between DM, HT, and CAD.\n",
      "Recent data have shown the inextricable relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and coronary artery disease (CAD).\n",
      "For instance, approximately 70% of patients with DM reported being affected by HT, which is about twice as common in patients with DM as in those without it [1].\n",
      "Furthermore, patients with both DM and HT were reported to have double the risk for CAD, which is the most prevalent cause of morbidity in type 1 or type 2 DM [2].\n",
      "However, the underlying genetic contributions driving the increased prevalence of HT and CAD in diabetic patients are poorly understood.\n",
      "There have been many studies seeking to understand the mechanisms of complex traits using a single-locus-based approach, but they have not been capable of explaining their complicated genetic effects.\n",
      "Instead, it is necessary to consider the joint genetic effects produced through the simultaneous perturbation of epistatically interacting variants.\n",
      "Consequently, epistasis is now increasingly assumed to be an important factor in demonstrating complex disease, and there are many studies in which evidence of epistasis has been found [3].\n",
      "Unfortunately, in spite of such efforts, most such studies usually have been conducted in a European descent cohort [4] and have not included any Asian patients.\n",
      "In this work, we performed a genomewide epistasis analysis using the East Asian cohort from Korea Association Resource (KARE) data.\n",
      "This is meaningful work, because obvious differences exist between ethnically diverse populations, such as susceptibility genes, allele frequency, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure.\n",
      "Most genetic variants associated with complex disease are usually located in non-coding genomic regions, and many studies have suggested that such variants might be involved in a transcriptional regulatory role [5].\n",
      "In this regard, when building an appropriate model, it can be very limiting to assign affected genes using only the nearest ones.\n",
      "For systematic annotation, therefore, we have suggested extensive non-coding variant annotation using regulatory elements, including promoters and distal enhancers.\n",

      "To identify the genetic risk factors of METS, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for 2,657 cases and 5,917 controls in Korean populations.\n",
      "As a result, we could identify 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significance level p-values (<5 × 10-8), 8 SNPs with genome-wide suggestive p-values (5 × 10-8 ≤ p < 1 × 10-5), and 2 SNPs of more functional variants with borderline p-values (5 × 10-5 ≤ p < 1 × 10-4).\n",
      "On the other hand, the multiple correction criteria of conventional GWASs exclude false-positive loci, but simultaneously, they discard many true-positive loci.\n",
      "To reconsider the discarded true-positive loci, we attempted to include the functional variants (nonsynonymous SNPs [nsSNPs] and expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL]) among the top 5,000 SNPs based on the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genotypic variance.\n",
      "In total, 159 eQTLs and 18 nsSNPs were presented in the top 5,000 SNPs.\n",
      "Although they should be replicated in other independent populations, 6 eQTLs and 2 nsSNP loci were located in the molecular pathways of LPL, APOA5, and CHRM2, which were the significant or suggestive loci in the METS GWAS.\n",
      "Conclusively, our approach using the conventional GWAS, reconsidering functional variants and pathway-based interpretation, suggests a useful method to understand the GWAS results of complex traits and can be expanded in other genomewide association studies.\n",
      "Metabolic syndrome (METS) is a disorder of energy utilization and storage and increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n",
      "METS includes multiple clinical traits, as follows: increased plasma glucose, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure [1].\n",
      "METS is a great concern in developing countries, because the prevalence of METS is gradually increasing, especially in countries where it follows obesity trends, sedentary lifestyle, and high consumption of calories [2, 3, 4].\n",
      "A Korean twin study showed that the METS has 51%-60% heritability, indicating a significant role of genetic factors in the development of METS [5].\n",
      "Therefore, understanding the genetic factors underlying the syndrome and their correlation is clinically important.\n",
      "Recent advances in high-throughput genomics technologies have allowed massive testing of genetic variants in minimal time [6, 7].\n",
      "The reductions in cost and time have made it feasible to conduct large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that genotype many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals.\n",
      "So far, approximately 1,900 reports with 13,000 SNPs (GWAS catalog; Apr 14, 2014) have been published to identify the gene-disease or -non-disease trait associations.\n",
      "The quantitative traits related to METS have already been studied by the conventional GWAS in the Korean population [8], but there is no Korean GWAS report about METS cases and controls.\n",
      "On the other hand, relatively little trait heritability can be explained by the conventional GWAS [9].\n",
      "These phenomena, called missing heritability problems, are hard to solve by conventional GWAS, in part because of the extensive multiple testing correction in GWAS analysis, low effect size of common variants, and the difficulty of detecting low-frequency or rare variants in conventional GWAS.\n",
      "Multiple testing correction is necessary to exclude false-positive loci, but simultaneously, it discards many true-positive loci [10].\n",
      "Also, most SNPs in these GWASs lie in intergenic and intron regions and do not appear to affect protein sequence.\n",
      "Thus, these SNPs are likely functionally neutral or just proxies of causal variants located in the same linkage disequilibrium (LD).\n",
      "To understand the amount of true-positive signals in the discarded association results, we computed the proportion [V(G)/V(P)] of the phenotypic variance [V(P)] that is explained by the genotype variance [V(G)] using the significant and discarded SNP results [11].\n",

      "However, GWASs focus more on individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), explaining only a small portion of genetic heritability.\n",
      "To overcome this limitation, pathway analyses are being applied to GWAS datasets.\n",
      "The aim of this study is to elucidate the biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of MetS through pathway analysis.\n",
      "Cohort data from the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) was used for analysis, which include 8,842 individuals (age, 52.2 ± 8.9 years; body mass index, 24.6 ± 3.2 kg/m2).\n",
      "A total of 312,121 autosomal SNPs were obtained after quality control.\n",
      "Pathway analysis was conducted using Meta-analysis Gene-Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA) to discover the biological pathways associated with MetS.\n",
      "In the discovery phase, SNPs from chromosome 12, including rs11066280, rs2074356, and rs12229654, were associated with MetS (p < 5 × 10-6), and rs11066280 satisfied the Bonferroni-corrected cutoff (unadjusted p < 1.38 × 10-7, Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05).\n",

      "Through pathway analysis of MetS, pathways related with PDGF, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PPAR signaling, as well as nucleic acid binding, protein secretion, and DNA repair, were identified.\n",
      "Further studies will be needed to clarify the genetic pathogenesis leading to MetS.\n",
      "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder related to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases, and its prevalence is continuously increasing worldwide [1, 2].\n",
      "Insulin resistance, obesity, and inflammation are major factors leading to MetS; however, the effect of genetic and environmental factors cannot be ignored [3].\n",
      "Sedentary lifestyle, decreased physical activity, high caloric intake, and westernized food habits are environmental factors leading to obesity and MetS [4, 5].\n",
      "Parental and maternal obesity in early pregnancy is related to increased risk of childhood obesity, which could later lead to obesity in young adulthood [6, 7].\n",
      "In addition, family history of obesity, insulin resistance, and T2DM can increase the risk of MetS, implying the importance of genetic contribution.\n",
      "Candidate gene studies in MetS identified genes involved in glucose and insulin signaling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and genes involved in lipid metabolism, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ), apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) [3, 8, 9, 10].\n",
      "Through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), a larger number of candidate genes could be further analyzed, and important susceptibility loci were discovered, including fat mass and obesity associated protein (FTO) and the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R), which were associated with body mass index (BMI) [11, 12].\n",
      "In another GWAS of MetS, the lipid locus at rs964184 was associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [13].\n",
      "In a meta-analysis in Korea that used the GWAS results from the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) cohort, susceptibility loci in 12q24.11 and 12q24.13 were associated with HDL-cholesterol levels, and genetic factors associated with osteoporosis and metabolic traits, such as T2DM, dyslipidemia, and obesity, could also be identified [14, 15, 16].\n",
      "GWASs have their strengths in screening susceptible genes associated with complex diseases [17, 18].\n",
      "However, GWASs focus more on individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that meet a stringent statistical significance, rather than explaining the interaction of genes, and they can only explain a small portion of genetic heritability [19, 20, 21].\n",
      "In addition, due to its small effect size, certain SNPs in a GWAS that have been identified to be associated with a disease might not show up in another study of the same disease.\n",
      "This can be seen in two published studies of T2DM and Crohn's disease, which could not find most of the proven susceptibility loci through GWASs and succeeded in achieving moderate significance after replication studies or meta-analysis [22, 23].\n",
      "To overcome this limitation, pathway-based approaches have been introduced to improve the interpretability of the GWAS.\n",
      "Pathway-based analysis integrates GWAS data with genes in the selected biological pathways or gene sets from predefined human databases [19, 24].\n",
      "The strength of pathway analysis is its large effect size and higher power to detect genes that might have been missed through a GWAS [24, 25, 26].\n",
      "Pathway analysis, such as Meta-analysis Gene-Set Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA), only requires the SNP p-values and chromosome positions, simplifying the analysis of GWASs [27].\n",

      "At the FDR level, although all pathways were above 0.05, the pathway of electron carrier activity had an FDR value < 0.1, and the pathways of signaling by PDGF and PPAR signaling showed an FDR < 0.2.\n",
      "In this study, through pathway analysis of MetS, important pathways, including electron carrier activity, signaling by PDGF, MAPKKK cascade, PDGF binding, nucleic acid binding, PPAR signaling, negative regulation of genespecific transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, non-motor microtubule binding protein, protein secretion, and DNA repair, were identified.\n",
      "In the previous GWAS using KARE cohorts, rs11066280 and rs2074356 in chromosome 12q24.13, near the chromosome 12 open reading frame, human C12orf51 (C12orf51), and rs12229654 in chromosome 12q24.11, near myosin, light chain 2 (MYL2) were identified to be associated with HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, T2DM, and dyslipidemia [14, 34].\n",
      "Drinking behavior was also associated with rs11066280 (C12orf51) in Korean men and Han Chinese [34, 35].\n",
      "In other published GWASs on BMI, important variants on loci near/in FTO, MC4R, and transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18) were associated with BMI, the latter also having a strong association with BMI in children [36].\n",
      "Genetic variants in zinc finger protein 259 (ZNF259), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and APOA5 were also associated with MetS [37].\n",
      "In the GWAS of European Americans and Finnish cohorts, APOC1 was related with dyslipidemia and central obesity, and the gene cluster region in SNP rs964184, near/in gene APOA1/C3/A4/A5, was associated with MetS [3, 38].\n",
      "Through MAGENTA analysis, pathways related with electron carrier activity and PDGF signaling and binding, as well as PPAR signaling, were identified as some of the top ranking pathways associated with MetS.\n",
      "Electron carrier activity may be related with electron transport activity in the mitochondria.\n",
      "Abnormal regulation of mitochondrial function is associated with factors, such as reduced electron transport chain, which can lead to insulin resistance and MetS [39, 40].\n",
      "In obese and diabetic patients, fewer and diminished mitochondrial electron transport enzymes, especially complex I, were observed in the skeletal muscle [41, 42, 43].\n",
      "Defects in the electron transport chain can impair carbohydrate metabolism, affecting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and limiting ATP activity, which could result in lactic acidosis [44].\n",
      "In addition, mitochondria respiratory chains are major sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and excess electrons can increase ROS, stimulating proinflammatory processes and mutagenesis, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction [40, 45].\n",
      "Pathways related to PDGF binding and signaling and the MAPKKK cascade were also associated with MetS in this study.\n",
      "The PDGF signaling pathway has been identified to be associated with BMI [29].\n",
      "PDGF is an important activator of cell proliferation and migration, mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, and PDGF signaling regulates angiogenesis [46, 47].\n",
      "In animal studies, PDGF-mediated pathways played a crucial role in healing myocardial infarction, myocardial fibrosis, and defects in the pathway lead to prolongation of inflammation [48, 49].\n",
      "In a human study, serum PDGF isoform b levels were lower in individuals with MetS, while increased PDGF expression with elevated urinary PDGF-BB was seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy [50, 51].\n",
      "MAPK pathways are involved in adipogenesis and metabolic homeostasis, and defects in these pathways due to factors, such as oxidative stress, can lead to abnormal adipose regulation, insulin resistance, and obesity [52, 53].\n",
      "In addition, increased MAPK signaling had a detrimental effect on β-cell function and insulin homeostasis, which could contribute to the development of MetS [54].\n",
      "The PPAR isotypes PPAR-α, -δ, and -γ play an important role in lipid and glucose metabolism [55].\n",
      "PPAR-α is expressed in tissues, including skeletal muscle and liver, regulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes, whereas PPAR-δ and PPAR-γ are involved in adipocyte differentiation [56].\n",
      "Genetic variations in PPAR can affect glucose uptake, fasting glucose levels, and BMI [57, 58, 59].\n",
      "In a GWAS of T2DM in a Finnish population, variants near PPAR-γ were associated with T2DM [60].\n",
      "In a Korean study, polymorphisms in PPAR-δ were related with BMI and fasting glucose in non-diabetics [61].\n",
      "Other pathways related with nucleic acids, such as RNA and DNA, as well as pathways of protein secretion were also associated with MetS.\n",

      "Abnormal expression of microRNAs in pancreatic beta-cells affects beta-cell function and insulin secretion [65].\n",
      "MicroRNA expression is also related to appetite control in the brain; neural signaling in the muscle, pancreas, and liver; and biological processes of lipid metabolism, which are linked to obesity [65, 66].\n",
      "In addition, microRNA-33 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, regulating insulin signaling and fatty acid regulation, and may be a therapeutic target for treating MetS [67].\n",
      "Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important cause, leading to diabetes [68].\n",
      "DNA damage in mitochondria and vascular cells can have a detrimental effect on mitochondrial function, increasing ROS production and promoting atherosclerosis [68, 69].\n",
      "Variations in mitochondrial DNA can also lead to MetS, hyperinsulinemia, and T2DM [70, 71, 72].\n",
      "In addition, insulin also regulates DNA repair, and a chronic hyperglycemic state can damage DNA, contributing to genomic mutation, which can be associated with cancer [73].\n",
      "Abnormal protein secretion can affect metabolic traits, proven through studies demonstrating increased secretion of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), and frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4), associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and abnormal insulin sensitivity [74, 75, 76].\n",
      "Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), expressed in adipocytes and liver, showed a positive correlation with MetS in a Chinese population, associated with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia [77, 78].\n",
      "The exact association between the pathway of non-motor microtubule binding and MetS can not be explained.\n",

      "More studies will be needed to elucidate the association between non-motor microtubule binding and MetS.\n",
      "One of the strengths of this study is the usage of a pathway-based approach to further analyze the KARE GWAS datasets.\n",
      "Pathway-based approaches of MetS in Asians are relatively scarce.\n",
      "Therefore, this study might help further elucidate the pathophysiology of MetS.\n",
      "Although the pathways identified in our study did not show an FDR value < 0.05, important pathways related with BMI, lipid and glucose metabolism, including signaling by PDGF and PPAR signaling, had an FDR < 0.2.\n",
      "Other pathway-based approaches will be needed to further validate the identified pathways.\n",
      "Pathway-based analysis has its strengths in improving the interpretability of the GWAS.\n",

      "In addition, the limited knowledge base and imprecision of gene annotations restricts their usage and integration with other analysis methods [81].\n",
      "Therefore, these limitations will need to be improved to generalize this approach and increase its applicability.\n",

      "In general, the hepatitis C virus is often associated with diabetes, and some diabetics may even develop chronic hepatitis [7].\n",
      "Gastritis is influenced by hepatitis.\n",
      "If we have hepatitis, the probability of getting gastritis is increased 1.5 times.\n",
      "Especially, chronic gastritis develops by chronic hepatitis [8].\n",
      "Sometimes, allergy cahepatitis.\n",
      "It increases the probability of hepatitis by 1.8 times.\n",
      "Hepatitis virus can cause arthritis [9]; it increases the probability of arthritis by 1.9 times.\n",
      "The degree of albumin is inversely proportional to hepatitis (odds ratio [OR], 0.8), because the liver makes albumin, and hepatitis enervates the process.\n",
      "The OR between external head injury and hepatitis is very high (OR, 1.31).\n",
      "We cannot explain the medical relationship between them.\n",
      "It needs more analysis.\n",
      "Table 6 shows AUC values from the variables in Table 5.\n",

      "From the epidemiological analysis, we found relevant variables with hepatitis.\n",
      "We confirmed that hepatitis has a wide relation with other diseases.\n",

      "Recently, new methods have been developed for estimating the current and recent changes in effective population sizes.\n",
      "Based on the methods, the effective population sizes of Korean populations were estimated using data from the Korean Association Resource (KARE) project.\n",
      "The overall changes in the population sizes of the total populations were similar to CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China) and JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) of the HapMap project.\n",
      "There were no differences in past changes in population sizes with a comparison between an urban area and a rural area.\n",
      "Age-dependent current and recent effective population sizes represent the modern history of Korean populations, including the effects of World War II, the Korean War, and urbanization.\n",
      "The oldest age group showed that the population growth of Koreans had already been substantial at least since the end of the 19th century.\n",
      "Effective population size (Ne) is the theoretically useful population size of an ideal population, in which the influence of random genetic drift is identical to that of the actual population [1].\n",
      "Therefore, the effective population size is a good representative of the genetic potential of the actual population; yet, it is easier to handle population genetic problems.\n",
      "There are several kinds of effective population size, depending on the focus of measurement [2, 3, 4, 5], and the most representative ones are the inbreeding effective population size, the variance effective population size, and the eigenvalue effective population size.\n",
      "The variance effective population is easy conceptually, and it can be estimated based on the gene (or allele) frequencies [6, 7] or heterozygote excess [8].\n",
      "In addition, the estimation can be based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) [9], and advanced related methods based on LD have been applied to human genome data to infer the past population history of human populations [10, 11, 12].\n",
      "Recently, new methods have been developed to estimate the current Ne and recent changes in Ne [13, 14].\n",
      "In studies, the effective population size of the current generation was estimated based on deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and an effective population size of recent generations was estimated using the linkage equilibrium (LE) between variants in different chromosomes [13].\n",
      "The past population changes can be inferred from the LD decay, depending on recombination rate [14].\n",
      "Different from previous methods using regressive methods [10, 11, 12], the relationship between the effective population size of the previous generation and that of the current generation [14] was presented by improving a recurrence formula of previous studies [15, 16].\n",
      "The applications of these studies to human genome data showed excellent agreement with the actual recent changes of various human populations [13, 14].\n",
      "HapMap Phase III data were used for studies to infer the past population histories of various human populations.\n",
      "There were similar data for Korean populations (the Korean HapMap data) [17, 18]; however, for the continuity of the results, the data were not included for the analyses in previous studies [13, 14].\n",
      "In 2007, right after the Korean HapMap data, the Korea Association Resource (KARE) was initiated to enable genomewide analyses for 8,842 individuals from the population-based cohorts [19].\n",
      "The effort was successful in revealing new and population-specific genetic factors of various traits [19, 20, 21, 22].\n",
      "The KARE data were also provided to many other researchers, which yielded many novel findings [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\n",
      "In the current study, the current and recent effective population sizes of Koreans were estimated, and the past changes in effective population sizes were studied using the KARE data.\n",
      "Different from the HapMap data, the KARE data contain many more individuals with their age information.\n",
      "In addition to the analyses of the total population, region-specific and age-specific analyses were conducted in the current study.\n",
      "Title: Estimating Ne based on HWE deviations, LE deviations, and LD decay\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the formula for testing HWE [31], estimating the effective population sizes of current populations utilizes the deviations of HWE, as shown in Eq.\n",
      "(1) from a previous study [13].\n",
      "(1) where n is the sample size, and the expectation indicates the mean value of HWE deviations.\n",
      "AA is the observed genotype frequency of a variant, and AA is the observed allele frequency of a variant.\n",
      "The same as the HapMap data, the KARE data excluded variants that deviated from HWE for a significance level of 0.001.\n",
      "Therefore, similar to the previous study, the mean of the HWE deviations should be adjusted by dividing the mean by the correction term of 0.9873 [13].\n",
      "A variant in a chromosome is in LE with a variant in another chromosome; however, the random genetic drift induces deviation from LE.\n",
      "The deviations depend on the effective population size of recent generations, and the recent effective population size can be estimated using the deviations.\n",
      "Assuming a constant population size, the effective population size that reflects recent changes in population size (the recent Ne) can be estimated based on Eq.\n",
      "(2), which was derived in a previous study [13].\n",
      "The estimate is different from the inbreeding Ne estimate using unlinked loci [9, 32].\n",
      "(2) where n indicates the sample size.\n",
      "As indicated previously [13], the correction due to sampling involves 1/2Ne, in addition to 1/n, because the haplotype frequencies were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation [9, 33, 34].\n",
      "If the haplotypes are derived directly from the genotyping or sequencing, the correction term due to sampling should be 1/n.\n",
      "Title: The decay of LD between linked loci is different, depending on the recombination rate.\n",
      "Based on this information, the past population history can be inferred.\n",
      "The LD estimates at a certain recombination rate contain the influences of all Ne values from the current to a certain number of past generations [14].\n",
      "Therefore, the previous study showed that the changes of Ne estimates, depending on recombination rate, just represent an overall picture of past population history by comparing the actual estimates to the estimates of various past population histories.\n",
      "Similar to the previous study, the effective population sizes were estimated using the linked variants, depending on the recombination rates, between the variants (Eqs.\n",
      "1 and 3-5).\n",
      "Following the previous assumptions [13, 34], constant population sizes and LD at equilibrium were assumed.\n",
      "(3)\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Eq.\n",
      "(3) presents the relationship between LD estimates at equilibrium (r2eq), Ne, and recombination rate (C).\n",
      "The LD estimates in Eq.\n",
      "(3) indicate the estimates of the original population, excluding the sampling bias.\n",
      "Sampling causes more complicated relationships in the LD estimates of the linked variants than the LD estimates of unlinked variants, due to the maximum likelihood estimation of haplotype frequencies [14].\n",
      "Therefore, as shown in Eq.\n",
      "(4), the LD estimates of sampled populations (r2s) include the influence of the Ne of the original population instead of a simpler factor, 1/(2ns), in addition to the influence of sample size (ns) and the LD estimates of the original population (r2o).\n",
      "(4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: To eliminate sampling bias, the Ne of the original population should be known.\n",
      "It is possible to combine and solve Eqs.\n",
      "(3) and (4) for a given ns and r2s.\n",
      "A better way is to use the Ne estimate of the current generation (Eq.\n",
      "1) in the recurrent formula in a previous study [14].\n",
      "By doing so, Eq.\n",
      "(5) was derived.\n",
      "(5)\n",
      "\n",
      "In Eq.\n",
      "(5), Ne indicates the effective population size at equilibrium for recombination rate (C); Nec indicates the effective population size of the current generation from Eq.\n",
      "(1); r2o indicates the LD estimates of the original population; and r2eq indicates the LD estimates at equilibrium from the generation when the LD estimates reached equilibrium to the previous generation right before the current generation -i.e., the parent generation.\n",
      "Therefore, to estimate Ne at equilibrium for a certain recombination rate, Nec should be estimated first.\n",
      "The estimated Nec is incorporated into Eq.\n",
      "(4) to derive r2o.\n",
      "In Eq.\n",
      "(5), substituting r2eq with the expression in Eq.\n",
      "(3) provides a cubic equation of Ne in which Ne can be solvable.\n",
      "The Ne estimates could be examined, depending on various recombination rates, to infer past population histories in which the impact of current Ne was excluded.\n",
      "Title: Data\n",
      "\n",
      "The KARE data were generated and kindly provided through a grant program by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "The data consisted of a total of 8,842 individuals: 4,637 from Ansan (an urban area) and 4,205 from Anseong (a rural area) in Gyeonggi province.\n",
      "There were 32 groups depending on ages from 39 to 70, and the numbers of individuals in each of the 32 groups were: 21, 421, 469, 489, 485, 473, 426, 400, 368, 291, 325, 268, 215, 207, 241, 242, 259, 197, 225, 238, 231, 255, 239, 230, 232, 254, 270, 210, 254, 200, 194, and 13, respectively.\n",
      "Because there were small numbers of individuals for the ages of 39 and 70, they were combined with the age groups of 40 and 69, respectively.\n",
      "Therefore, the total number of age groups was 30.\n",
      "It is neither necessary nor efficient to use all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), because estimating Ne does not require many variants.\n",
      "Only 10,000 SNPs or 1,000 pairs of SNPs were enough to estimate the correct Ne in the simulations of previous studies [13, 14].\n",
      "In the simulation studies, the variances were least biased for the most frequent variants.\n",
      "Therefore, the same as in previous studies [13, 14], SNPs with minor allele frequencies higher than 0.4 and without missing genotypes were used for the analyses.\n",
      "The estimates of LD were the r2 estimates-i.e., the squared correlation coefficient between two variants.\n",
      "The current effective population size was 100,778 using the total population.\n",
      "The estimate was much larger than the estimates using the HapMap data.\n",
      "The largest Ne in the populations of the HapMap data was 10,437 using CEUp (the parents of Utah, USA residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe).\n",
      "The estimate of the Korean population was approximately 10 times larger than the largest estimates using the HapMap data.\n",
      "From the definition, the effective population size is influenced by many factors, such as mating structure, migration, and admixture [1].\n",
      "No big difference is expected in the mating structure between KARE and HapMap.\n",
      "Because Korean populations were relatively rarely admixed, the inflation of Ne due to admixture could be excluded.\n",
      "The effects of migration on Ne estimates were studied previously [35, 36].\n",
      "The Ne, based on LD, which is more robust than the joint estimation of Ne and migration rate, could be overestimated to be close to the global (metapopulation) Ne when the migration rate is high [35].\n",
      "After the Korean War, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) experienced severe urbanization and extreme population concentration in a metropolitan area [37].\n",
      "The percentage of the population in an urban area was more than 70% of the total population in the late 1980s [37].\n",
      "A high population density due to migration introduces good opportunities to meet a diverse partner within the population, which increases Ne.\n",
      "The population density of the Republic of Korea is among the highest among nations, ranking 20th among a total of 265 countries or areas (https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A14).\n",
      "Due to the Korean War and urbanization, the Gyeonggi province, located in the middle of the Korean peninsula, has experienced severe migration.\n",
      "Because the capital, Seoul, is located in the middle of Gyeonggi province, the region has also experienced a severe concentration of the population.\n",
      "These factors might explain the large effective population size.\n",
      "Fig.1 shows the LD status of the total population, the population of the urban area, and the population of the rural area, depending on recombination rates.\n",
      "In the previous study, the r2 decay plots of chromosome 14, depending on recombination rates, were prominently higher than the plots of other chromosomes [14]; however, in the current study, none of the Korean populations showed increases in the r2 estimates of chromosome 14 (Fig.1 and Supplementary Fig.1 for the age groups).\n",
      "However, when the region from 65,700 kb to 6,800 kb, which is responsible for the increases in the r2 estimates in the previous study, was examined, similar allele frequency spectra were seen (Fig.2A).\n",
      "The frequency spectra show significant concentrations of specific minor allele frequencies (higher than 0.4), indicating selection pressures in the region.\n",
      "Other populations in the HapMap data showed similar trends of selection pressures, but the concentrated frequencies usually were less than 0.4 [14].\n",
      "The most similar spectra among the HapMap data were JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) and CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China), and the frequency spectrum of KARE looked like a mixture of the spectra of JPT and CHB.\n",
      "In a previous study [14], CHD (Chinese in metropolitan Denver, CO, USA) was almost the same as CHB.\n",
      "Although the distributions were more dispersed, ASW (African ancestry in southwest USA) and MEX (Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, CA, USA) were similar to CHB.\n",
      "The genotype data were generated using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 [19]; however, the genotype data of the HapMap project were generated using two platforms of the Illumina Human 1M and the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 [38].\n",
      "Because of the difference in the platforms used, the current study showed a smaller number of SNPs in the region (Fig.2A).\n",
      "If the same platforms were used for genotyping, similar increases in the r2 estimates of chromosome 14 to JPT and CHB might be observed in Fig.1 [14].\n",
      "The region contains the complete gephyrin gene (GPHN).\n",
      "In Fig.2B, a huge LD block of the region was observed using Haploview [39], similar to a previous study [14].\n",
      "The past population history of the total population is shown in Fig.1.\n",
      "Excluding the influence of current effective population size, the past population history of Koreans was similar to the CHB of the HapMap data.\n",
      "The results looked reasonable, considering the similarity of the modern histories between Korea and China, which include the resistance to Western civilizations and the short period of colonization.\n",
      "However, there is a huge difference between the current Ne of Korean populations and the current Ne of CHB.\n",
      "The current Ne of CHB was 2,926 [14].\n",
      "The Chinese government has enforced a one-child policy since 1978; however, the Korean government encouraged a two-child policy without any forcible action [40].\n",
      "These differences in policy might have resulted in significant differences in the current Ne sizes of the Korean and Chinese populations.\n",
      "The populations of both the urban and rural areas showed similar past population histories as that of the total population (Fig.1).\n",
      "Fig.3 shows the estimates of the current and recent effective population sizes of various age groups.\n",
      "Because the initial sample collection was conducted from 2001 to 2003, the year of birth for individuals aged 69 to 40 would be 1933 to 1962, respectively, if the baseline year of collection were assumed to be 2002.\n",
      "Therefore, there could be inaccuracies of 1 or 2 years in assigning the year of birth.\n",
      "The recent Ne involves recent changes in the effective population sizes, usually within a few generations.\n",
      "Therefore, the recent effective population sizes were larger than the current effective population sizes in Fig.3, because the current Ne of individuals born in a certain year merely represents the effective population size of the population born in a certain year.\n",
      "However, the recent Ne represents the effective population sizes of several previous generations.\n",
      "The current effective population sizes were mostly between 5,000 and 30,000, and the recent effective population sizes were usually higher than the current Ne and increased as the year of birth increased.\n",
      "The current and recent Ne of samples with age 69 or older (born in 1933) was 9,457 and 20,165, respectively.\n",
      "For comparison, the maximum estimate of the current Ne of the HapMap data was 10,437.\n",
      "The current Ne of Koreans born in 1933 was already large, probably because of the high population density in Korea.\n",
      "The recent Ne, which is double the current Ne, indicates that the population growth of Korea lasted long before the colonial domination by Japan in 1910.\n",
      "There were two age groups of 58 and 63, for which the current Ne estimates were less than 5,000.\n",
      "The corresponding years are 1944 and 1939, respectively.\n",
      "World War II began in 1939 and ended in 1945, and comparatively fewer births would be expected during the period.\n",
      "However, there was a large increase of the current Ne in 1943, presenting a nettlesome question.\n",
      "There were several large increases of the current Ne in 1943, 1947, 1952, and 1958.\n",
      "The increases in 1947 and 1958 could be explained by the baby boom right after the wars; however, 1943 and 1952 were the 2 years and 1 year, respectively, before the end of the wars, which lasted for 6 and 3 years, respectively.\n",
      "The current and recent Ne estimates were compared to the number of the total population and to the rates of population growth recorded in the Korean Statistical Almanac of the Korean Statistical Information Service (http://kosis.kr).\n",
      "The rates of population growth fit with the increased current Ne in 1943 if the 1-year inaccuracies in assigning the year of birth are considered.\n",
      "The increments of the current Ne in 1943 and 1952 could be due to the decreased crude death rate and increased migration rates [37].\n",
      "Using the KARE data, the current and recent effective population sizes of Korea were estimated, based on HWE and LE deviations, and the past changes in population sizes were derived, based on the pattern of LD decay.\n",
      "The results showed clear exponential growth of the Korean population, similar to CHB of the HapMap data.\n",
      "The population growth of China has been positive continuously since 1400, except for the period from 1683 to 1700 [41].\n",
      "The censuses in the Joseon Dynasty period of Korea showed low rates of population growth in the 1800s [37].\n",
      "The large recent Ne of the 69-year-old age group (born in 1933) indicates that Korea might have experienced continuous population growth at least in 1873, assuming a generation time of 20 years for the 3 most recent generations.\n",
      "A simulation result of rapid growth (Ne changes: 1000, 2000, 4000, 10,000) showed half (5,212) the current Ne [13]; however, the recent Ne of the 69-year-old age group was double the current Ne.\n",
      "Therefore, it is likely that the population growth started much earlier than 1873 [13, 14].\n",
      "In the metropolitan area, people from all over the country might have increased the Ne.\n",
      "The migration effects and the discrepancy between the census and the results need more explanations.\n",
      "The age-dependent Ne estimates showed good concordance with the actual modern history of Korea, although several of them require more explanation.\n",
      "Because of the inaccuracies in assigning the year of birth, a sample of the 58-year-old age group might be mixed with a sample of the age groups of 57 and 59.\n",
      "Although it is a rare occasion, individuals having genomic potential to increase current Ne in the 57 and 59 age groups might have been assigned to the 58-year-old age group accidently during the sample collection.\n",
      "In any case, the population growth in war time needs more explanation.\n",
      "In Fig.3, the trend of recent Ne followed the trend of current Ne in many cases.\n",
      "Especially, the increased current Ne in 1943 contributed to the rapid increase in the recent Ne in the late 1950s as the individuals born in 1943 could contribute to reproduction.\n",
      "The recent Ne decreased rapidly in the 42-year-old age group (born in 1960), which needs explanation.\n",
      "The baby-boom individuals born in 1958 were 2 years old and could not contribute to giving birth.\n",
      "The recent Ne increased again in 1961 and 1962, possibly due to the contributions of individuals who were born in the previous baby-boom period and reached reproductive age.\n",
      "In the previous studies, it was not necessary to analyze a large number of variants.\n",
      "However, the current study showed that the number of genotypes, as well as the number of individuals, might be important for the quality of the results to infer the past population history.\n",
      "In Supplementary Fig.2, the estimates of many age groups were less consistent, even with larger numbers of samples than the sample sizes of the HapMap data.\n",
      "The smallest sample size for the former was 197, and the largest sample size for the latter was 143.\n",
      "However, the number of genotypes would not have had much influence much on the estimations of the current and recent Ne, as indicated in previous simulation studies [13].\n",
      "Therefore, the possibility of lower genotype quality could not be excluded, either.\n",
      "It is also possible that inconsistent estimates were seen more in the CHB than in other populations, which showed the most rapid population growth.\n",
      "Because Korean populations showed more rapid population growth than CHB, the rapid growth might be the reason for the inconsistent estimates.\n",
      "With more genotypes, the increases in r2 estimates in chromosome 14 could also be seen clearly in Fig.1, similar to CHB and JPT of the HapMap project.\n",
      "The recent Ne of the total population was 2,518,501, which was incredibly large.\n",
      "Considering that the current Ne of the total population was 100,778, the KARE data showed that the population is under serious deduction of effective population size.\n",
      "The ratio of the current to recent Ne was 0.04.\n",
      "This small ratio might be due to migration and extreme population concentration to a metropolitan area.\n",
      "Migration might have had more influence on the recent Ne rather than the current Ne, because the recent Ne reflects the population that moved from all over the country.\n",
      "In addition, the division of the Korean peninsula after the Korean War might have resulted in the extreme ratio.\n",
      "The population moved to the metropolitan area from all over the country, but they could not move back to the northern part of the Korean peninsula.\n",
      "The ratio was not comparable to any of the HapMap data, in which 0.64 of JPT was the lowest, and all populations were concordant with their recent population changes.\n",
      "In Fig.3, the tendency started in 1933 for the eldest ones in the data, and it became more severe as the age of the sampled individuals decreased.\n",
      "The total sample contains more relatively young individuals than elders; however, the ratio of 0.04 was too small.\n",
      "If the ratios were correct, as shown in the HapMap data, Fig.3 shows that the significant reduction in effective population size began in 1953, right after the Korean War, probably due to migration and the division of the Korean peninsula.\n",

      "A high mutual information value indicates a strong association between two random variables.\n",
      "The measure can also be extended to assess the strength of association between a pair of SNPs and a phenotype.\n",
      "The extended version of mutual information is as follows: I(X1,X2;Y) = H(X1,X2) + H(Y) - H(X1,X2,Y), where X1 and X2 are random variables for two SNPs, and Y denotes random variables for the disease.\n",

      "Given the significant epistatic interactions between SNP pairs and disease status detected by the permutation scheme, we constructed SNP-SNP epistatic interaction networks, where SNP represents the node and the significant interaction between SNP pairs represents the edge.\n",
      "However, it is difficult to assess the biological significance of the interaction networks directly because of the lack of interaction databases for SNPs.\n",
      "To overcome this limitation, we directly mapped these networks into a gene-gene relevance network.\n",
      "Fig.1 represents a brief scheme of how to map the network.\n",
      "Suppose that some SNPs map directly to genes A and B, and there are at least two SNPs that have significant interactions for disease status.\n",
      "If one SNP maps to gene A and another SNP maps to gene B, then we consider that genes A and B have a unidirectional edge.\n",
      "The weight of the edge is defined by number of the interacting SNP pairs.\n",
      "For example, in Fig.1, there are four SNP interactions between gene A and gene B.\n",

      "Finally, the top 5% edges having the largest edge weights are used in the biological validation and topological investigation.\n",
      "We constructed a gene-gene network for each chromosome showing intra-chromosome interactions.\n",

      "Table 1 shows the number of statistically significant SNP pairs within each chromosome.\n",
      "Significant SNP pairs and p-values are listed in Supplementary Table 1.\n",
      "In total, 293 SNP pairs showed statistical significance in the study.\n",
      "Chromosomes 9 and 15 had many significant pairs, but many of those pairs included SNPs with marginal effects (rs169730 in chromosome 9, rs493971 in chromosome 15).\n",
      "There were few significant SNP pairs within the chromosomes, and these pairs were not found in previous studies of gastric disease; therefore, further investigation of the pairs is needed to assess their biological significance.\n",

      "Table 2 summarizes the results of the network topology measures (number of nodes and edges, clustering coefficient, and network centralization) for the gene-gene interaction network for each chromosome.\n",
      "The table shows that all chromosomes showed similar properties: the number of edges is 10-30-fold higher than the number of nodes, and the measurements reveal high clustering coefficients and network centralization.\n",
      "Additionally, every network from each chromosome consisted of only one component.\n",
      "Figs.4 and 5 present the structure of networks showing the highest values for the measures, especially the clustering coefficient and network centralization.\n",
      "In the real world, many biological networks show high average clustering coefficients [25].\n",
      "The network in chromosome 18 showed the highest clustering coefficient, and we found some hub genes in the network that were reported to be associated with gastric disease.\n",
      "For example, Uchino et al.\n",
      "[26] reported frequent loss of heterozygosity at the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) locus in gastric cancer.\n",
      "Higher network centralization values show that hub genes highly affect the network [27].\n",
      "In other words, if the hubs are removed, then the network may divide into several components.\n",

      "In the network receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase T (PTPRT), one of the hub genes was reported to be one of 15 genes in CpG islands showing significant differential methylation in gastric carcinoma [28].\n",
      "From the results, we determined that there were many close gene-gene interactions derived from SNP-SNP interactions for gastritis and that if a gene had a high degree in the network, then this gene was connected to other genes with which it had frequent SNP-SNP interactions.\n",

      "[29] reported that zinc-binding protein-89 (ZBP-89), which is related to the ZNF gene family and is a Krüppel-type zinc finger protein, is overexpressed in gastric cancer patients.\n",
      "Additionally, interleukin-1 receptor activity (GO:0004908) was significantly enriched in chromosome 2.\n",
      "Fig.7 presents the internal structure of the gene-gene relevance network for the GO terms.\n",
      "As mentioned in the introduction, interleukin family genes and intra-SNPs were reported [5, 7]; therefore, these genes and SNPs are associated with the susceptibility to gastric cancer.\n",
      "Genes that were enriched in the GO terms were not connected in the relevance gene-gene network; still, these genes had few SNP-SNP interactions with every other gene (weight equal or less than 11).\n",
      "We also ran an enrichment analysis for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway [30], but no terms were significant under FDR-based adjustment.\n",
      "In this study, we applied a simple but powerful method to detect epistatic interactions that distinguish gastritis patients from controls.\n",
      "We found several putative SNP-SNP interactions using the mutual information measure.\n",
      "Additionally, relevance gene-gene interaction networks that are derived from epistatic interactions show high clustering coefficients and centralization.\n",
      "We found that some sub-networks in the recovered network had biological significance for gastric disease from the GO enrichment analysis.\n",
      "However, we did not find these results to have direct associations with gastritis, because gastritis has been less extensively studied than other gastric diseases, such as gastric cancer or ulcer.\n",

      "Platelet activation is known to affect genes associated with vascular risk factors, as well as with arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Platelet count is a readily available laboratory test and has been associated with different clinical and epidemiologic factors and are tightly regulated and inversely correlated in the healthy population [3].\n",

      "The first 2 tests were linear regression analyses of lean (BMI < 25) and overweight subjects (BMI ≥ 25).\n",
      "The overall interactions between SNPs and BMI were analyzed using continuous BMI values and dichotomized BMI (lean subjects were coded with 1, and overweight subjects were coded with 2).\n",
      "Continuous BMI-SNP interaction analyses were performed using QUICKTEST (http://toby.freeshell.org/software/quicktest.shtml), and the dichotomized BMI-SNP interactions were analyzed using PLINK, version 1.07 [11].\n",
      "The fasting serum glucose and insulin levels of our subjects are shown in Table 1.\n",
      "We divided subjects into 4 groups, based on BMI; most Korean subjects lay in the 20 ≤ BMI < 25 and 25 ≤ BMI < 30 categories.\n",

      "Despite having lower BMIs, Asian countries have a similar or greater prevalence of diabetes versus Western countries [12].\n",
      "Thus, we used BMI < 25 and BMI ≥ 25 to analyze the effects of SNPs and SNP-dichotomized BMI interactions by stratum.\n",
      "Of the 6 SNPs that were associated with FSI levels in the MAGIC studies, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, and no SNP was replicated in all 3 statistical tests (stratified BMI, continuous BMI interaction p-values, and dichotomized BMI interaction p-values) (see Table 2).\n",
      "Of the 7 reported SNPs that were linked to fasting plasma glucose levels, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, and 1 SNP (rs2293941) in pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) was significantly associated in lean subjects (beta ± SE, 0.007 ± 0.002; p = 0.001) but not in overweight subjects.\n",
      "The SNP-continuous BMI interaction was not significant, but the SNP-dichotomized BMI interaction was marginal (p = 0.04).\n",
      "Our results indicate that the novel loci that were identified by MAGIC are poorly replicated in other ethnic groups, although we do not know why.\n",
      "We have identified an important genetic factor of glucose metabolism, PDX1, which regulates pancreatic beta-cell function and survival by governing expression of the insulin-encoding INS gene [13].\n",

      "These SNPs could not be extracted from the imputation data using the original Affy 5.0 in the KARE study.\n",
      "Another limitation of this study was the relatively weak significance of its association results compared with those of MAGIC.\n",
      "We do not know whether this lack of significance is due to the relatively smaller sample size of this study compared with MAGIC, the inaccuracy of imputation genotypes, or ethnic differences in the SNP-BMI interactions.\n",
      "These issues should be addressed in other Asian populations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mutation in HNF1B, the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) gene, results in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 5, which is characterized by gradual impairment of insulin secretion.\n",
      "However, the functional role of HNF-1β in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism is not fully understood.\n",
      "We identified a family with early-onset diabetes that fulfilled the criteria of MODY.\n",
      "Sanger sequencing revealed that a heterozygous P159L (CCT to CTT in codon 159 in the DNA-binding domain) mutation in HNF1B was segregated according to the affected status.\n",
      "To investigate the functional consequences of this HNF1B mutation, we generated a P159L HNF1B construct.\n",
      "The wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells in the presence of the promoter sequence of human glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2).\n",
      "The luciferase reporter assay revealed that P159L HNF1B had decreased transcriptional activity compared to wild-type (p < 0.05).\n",
      "Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed reduced DNA binding activity of P159L HNF1B.\n",
      "In the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line, overexpression of the P159L mutant was significantly associated with decreased mRNA levels of GLUT2 compared to wild-type (p < 0.05).\n",
      "However, INS expression was not different between the wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs.\n",
      "These findings suggests that the impaired insulin secretion in this family with the P159L HNF1B mutation may be related to altered GLUT2 expression in β-cells rather than decreased insulin gene expression.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have identified a Korean family with an HNF1B mutation and characterized its effect on the pathogenesis of diabetes.\n",
      "Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of diabetes characterized by an early onset, usually before the age of 25 years; an autosomal dominant inheritance; and a defect in pancreatic β-cell function [1].\n",
      "Depending on the specific gene mutation, the synthesis and secretion of insulin are altered at different stages.\n",
      "MODY is classified according to its affected genes, which include those encoding enzymes, transcription factors, and other types of proteins [1, 2].\n",
      "The transcription factors associated with MODY act in the nucleus of β-cells and regulate the transcription of INS or other genes encoding enzymes involved in glucose transport and metabolism [1].\n",
      "Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that forms a homodimer or heterodimer with structurally related HNF-1α [3].\n",

      "Its structure is characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of an atypical POU-specific (POUS) and POU-homeo (POUH) domain, but the molecular properties of HNF-1β have not been studied much.\n",
      "HNF-1 β is known for playing a role in tissue-specific gene expression in organs, including the liver, kidney, and pancreatic islets [4], and is involved in the β-cell transcription factor network [5].\n",
      "Heterozygous mutations of HNF1B, which encodes HNF-1β, result in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 5 (MODY5), which is characterized by early-onset diabetes and various abnormalities, such as renal cysts, renal impairment, genital malformation, or hepatobiliary involvement [6, 7, 8, 9].\n",
      "Patients with mutations in HNF1B have impaired insulin secretory responses to glucose and insulin secretagogues [7, 10, 11] and show progressive loss in basal insulin secretion.\n",
      "Mutation in HNF1B was first described by Horikawa et al.in 1997 [12].\n",

      "A certain mutation showed a gain-of-function phenotype [22, 23].\n",

      "In HNF1B-deficient mouse embryos, a dorsal bud of the pancreas is formed transiently and becomes absent, whereas the ventral bud is not affected [29].\n",
      "In two 8-week human fetuses with HNF1B mutations, severe pancreas hypoplasia was observed [30].\n",
      "With these consistent findings, the abnormality in the morphogenesis of the pancreas is thought to be one of the causes of diabetes in MODY5 patients.\n",
      "Another suggested molecular mechanism is related to altered GLUT2 expression.\n",
      "Wild-type HNF-1β is known to bind to the cis-element of GLUT2 and efficiently increase its transcription [24].\n",
      "In this study, overexpression of wild-type HNF-1β resulted in an increase in transcriptional activity of the GLUT2 promoter, whereas overexpression of the P159L mutant resulted in decreased GLUT2 expression.\n",
      "Previous studies showed similar results in various types of cells, such as COS-7, MIN6, and HepG2 [20, 24].\n",
      "GLUT2 is a low-affinity, high-capacity transporter expressed mainly in hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule cells, and pancreatic β-cells [31, 32].\n",
      "GLUT2 plays a role in β-cell insulin secretion, as it senses external glucose and transports it into pancreatic β-cells [33].\n",
      "In vivo studies showed that GLUT2-deficient mice were hyperglycemic, resulting in diabetes with impaired glucose sensing by pancreatic β-cells [34], and GLUT2 was undetectable on β-cells of the two HNF1B mutant fetuses [29].\n",
      "So, decreased expression of GLUT2 in β-cells, combined with a gradual reduction in insulin secretion, could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus in MODY5 patients.\n",
      "In addition, GLUT2 may also affect β-cell differentiation in the development of the pancreas [34, 35].\n",
      "EMSA was done to examine whether the reduced transcription activity was due to the decreased DNA-binding capacity.\n",
      "Both mutant HNF-1β proteins had decreased DNA-binding activity compared to the wild-type.\n",
      "It was previously reported that the H153N HNF-1β mutation had diminished DNA-binding activity [20].\n",
      "Since both P159L and H153N mutants have intact dimerization domains, it is possible that they could dimerize with wild-type HNF-1β [9].\n",
      "However, the mutant/wild-type dimer seems to have a defect in DNA binding and limited ability to increase the transcription of GLUT2.\n",
      "The mRNA expression of GLUT2 was increased with wild-type HNF-1β but significantly suppressed, almost to the level observed in the empty control vector, in both mutants.\n",
      "The findings of the real-time PCR analysis of GLUT2 were consistent with the reporter gene assay and DNA binding assay.\n",
      "On the other hand, there has been limited knowledge regarding the mRNA expression of INS with mutant HNF-1β.\n",
      "The mRNA levels of INS were not statistically different between the wild-type- and mutant-expressing MIN6 cells.\n",
      "In one study with HNF-1α, neither the wild-type nor the mutant activated GLUT2 or the insulin promoter in MIN6 cells [36].\n",
      "The authors concluded that endogenous HNF-1α, GLUT2, and insulin proteins in MIN6 cells could interfere in the transfected reporter assay.\n",
      "The mRNA expression of INS is also considered to be regulated by other transcription factors, and it might have been compensated for by complex mechanisms against the mutation of HNF1B.\n",
      "Overall, the impaired insulin secretion in MODY5 patients might be explained by pancreatic hypoplasia or β-cell dysgenesis rather than decreased mRNA expression of INS.\n",
      "As described above, decreased mRNA expression of GLUT2 might also result in the inhibition of insulin secretion.\n",
      "This study has some limitations.\n",
      "First, we could not sequence HNF1B of the patient's grandmother, who was also a patient with diabetes.\n",
      "If she had the same P159L mutation of HNF1B, it would have revealed an autosomal dominant inheritance more clearly.\n",
      "Second, alterations in insulin secretion with the mutation in the pancreatic β-cell line were not evaluated.\n",

      "We used three methods: GRM-based prediction (G-BLUP), random marker-based prediction using an identity matrix (so-called single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]-BLUP), and SNP-SNP variance-covariance matrix (so-called SNP-GBLUP).\n",

      "More novel RE-derived miRNAs were confirmed than identified as RE-derived miRNAs.\n",
      "In conclusion, many miRNAs have not yet been identified, most of which are derived from REs.\n",
      "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides (nt) in length and are single-stranded in their mature form.\n",
      "Primary miRNAs are expressed from genomic regions and processed to generate precursor miRNAs by Drosha [1].\n",
      "Precursor miRNAs have a hairpin structure; therefore, their sources (or, the genomic loci from which they originate) have a palindromic structure [2].\n",
      "The precursor miRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and processed into a duplex by Dicer, one of which is preferentially loaded into Argonaute (AGO) [1, 3].\n",
      "Mature miRNAs function via the RNA-induced silencing complex and AGO protein-mediated binding to the target mRNA by complementary base pairing to the 3' untranslated region [4].\n",
      "Repetitive elements (REs) are interspersed throughout the genome, and they increase genomic instability through various mechanisms.\n",
      "REs consist of transposable elements (TEs) and tandem repeats (e.g., satellite DNA, simple repeat DNA).\n",
      "REs can directly impact coding sequences or other functional sequences in the host genome as follows.\n",
      "They can affect transcription by acting as alternative promoters [5, 6, 7], forming structural isoforms through alternative exons, and by providing polyadenylation signal sites important in transcriptional termination [8].\n",
      "REs are also important for inhibiting gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by producing miRNA sequences [2, 9].\n",
      "REs comprise paralogous miRNA gene families and speciesspecific miRNA gene families [10].\n",
      "Some miRNAs originate from unique genomic sequences, and others originate from REs.\n",
      "Recently, the association of REs with miRNAs was established in several studies that demonstrated connections between miRNAs and TEs [9, 11, 12].\n",
      "These studies suggest that REs are important for miRNA origin, expression, and regulatory network formation [2, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\n",
      "Especially, some REs have a palindrome structure, and these sequences have great potential to make a precursor miRNA form.\n",
      "In previous studies, miniature inverted TE (MITE)-derived miRNAs were identified in the human genome [2].\n",
      "As one of the REs, medium reiterated sequences (MERs) have a palindrome structure in the mammalian genome [17].\n",
      "MERs were also predicted to make miRNAs [10], and MER-derived miRNAs were confirmed in experiments in human cell lines [11].\n",
      "REs are ubiquitous and scattered throughout the host genome in abundant numbers; therefore, these RE families have the possibility of making paralogous miRNAs.\n",
      "A MITE-derived miRNA, miR-548, has many homologous gene families [18], and a MER-derived miRNA, miR-1302, also has many homologous miRNAs in the human genome [10].\n",

      "In the case of hsa-miR-28, two LINE elements are oppositely oriented and then make one miRNA precursor form [15].\n",
      "Based on these results, we separated miRNAs in the case of two REs making one miRNA and of a palindrome structure RE making one miRNA.\n",
      "REs prefer rapid evolution compared to other genomic sequences; RE-derived miRNAs have a tendency to make phylogeny-specific miRNAs [9].\n",
      "In this respect, primate-specific Alu-derived miRNAs are primate-specific, and MITE-derived miR-548 was mainly discovered in primates [18].\n",
      "Genomic duplication events, such as segmental duplications or tandem duplications, also create REs and RE-derived miRNAs in animals [19, 20].\n",
      "Therefore, many RE-derived miRNAs were identified in the human, rhesus, and mouse genomes [20].\n",

      "Therefore, we assigned MITE-derived miRNAs and MER-derived miRNAs into the type 2 and type 3 categories, respectively.\n",

      "While comparing the quality with all experimentally determined protein chains in the current PDB using the ProSA web server [15] by means of a significant statistical score (z-score) in terms of folding energy, the second and third models had a z-score computed in the ProSA web server of -5.16 (Supplementary Fig.2B) and -5.6 (Supplementary Fig.2C), respectively, while in comparison, the current model had a good folding energy score-i.e., z-score of -5.96 (Supplementary Fig.2A).\n",
      "The overall quality factors of these two models were also compared with the current predicted model of kir6.2 using Errat2.\n",
      "The overall quality factor for the second and third models deposited in the Protein Model Portal was computed to be 69.132 (Supplementary Fig.3B) and 67.508 (Supplementary Fig.3C), respectively, which is quite poor in comparison to the quality score of 78.778 (Supplementary Fig.3A) computed for the current model of kir6.2 (PM0079770).\n",

      "Similarly, by comparison of the wild and mutant models of kir6.2, the quality is confirmed as good for both predicted models of kir6.2, because the values of the computed z-score of the computed models of kir6.2 are within the range of z-scores of the groups of structures from different sources, like X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance (Supplementary Fig.6).\n",
      "The Ramachandran plot statistics (Supplementary Fig.7) show 93.8% of residues in the most favored region in the case of the wild kir6.2 model, whereas in the mutant model, 92.8% of residues are found in the same region.\n",
      "At the same time, no residues were found in the disallowed region in both the wild and mutant models of kir6.2, which signified the good quality of the backbone folding pattern in both models.\n",
      "The non-bonded interactions between different atoms were plotted residue-wise against error function to calculate the overall quality factor of both models in Errat2, which justified the improvement in quality of kir6.2 mutant model (Supplementary Fig.8).\n",
      "The comparison of secondary structural elements of both wild-type and mutant kir6.2 (Supplementary Table 1) reveals that there is an increment in disordered regions in the mutant model, but there is no major structural deviation due to the mutation introduced at the sequence level (Fig.1).\n",

      "As per the information in Table 2, the amino acids Phe-183 and Arg-301 have common involvement in hydrogen bonding in the mutant model of the kir6.2 protein with curcumin, genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene, suggesting strong binding affinity in the predicted binding pocket.\n",
      "It is a well-established fact that the main cause of type 1 diabetes is the autoimmune destruction of β-cells in the pancreas [1].\n",
      "Reports demonstrate that kir6.2 is an ATP/ADP ratio-sensitive protein that plays a vital role in operating the K+ channel and simultaneously controls Ca+2 ion channel function, which in turn triggers the exocytosis of insulin.\n",

      "Again, due to the unavailability of the crystal structure of kir6.2, molecular targeting with drugs is difficult.\n",
      "But, a rational design of in silico structure prediction approaches comes in handy under such circumstances to study this further.\n",
      "From the structural inspection of both wild-type and mutant kir6.2 models, it is concluded that mutation has no major structural changes or deviation in the structure quality of the model.\n",
      "In recent years, due to the adverse effect of synthetic drugs, phytochemicals have drawn substantial attention as alternative medications.\n",
      "The literature reports curcumin, genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene to have strong inhibitory effects against type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Hence, all four of these phytochemicals were docked with predicted models of kir6.2 in the ATP-binding pocket [12] to check the inhibitory effect after mutation.\n",
      "The results of docking suggested that all phytochemicals bind at high affinity with both models, and the common interacting residues Ala-178, Leu-181, Phe-183, and Ala-300 were found in the same pocket, even after mutation.\n",
      "Amino acid residues, like Phe-183 and Arg-301, have also been observed as participating in hydrogen bonding within the binding pocket of mutant kir6.2 in the case of docking with all four inhibitors, supporting the fact that mutation might not affect the binding affinity of kir6.2 protein with phytochemicals.\n",

      "Fatty acid synthase (FASN, EC 2.3.1.85), is a multi-enzyme dimer complex that plays a critical role in lipogenesis.\n",
      "This lipogenic enzyme has gained importance beyond its physiological role due to its implications in several clinical conditions-cancers, obesity, and diabetes.\n",
      "This has made FASN an attractive pharmacological target.\n",
      "Here, we have attempted to predict the theoretical models for the human enoyl reductase (ER) and β-ketoacyl reductase (KR) domains based on the porcine FASN crystal structure, which was the structurally closest template available at the time of this study.\n",
      "Comparative modeling methods were used for studying the structure-function relationships.\n",
      "Different validation studies revealed the predicted structures to be highly plausible.\n",
      "The respective substrates of ER and KR domains-namely, trans-butenoyl and β-ketobutyryl-were computationally docked into active sites using Glide in order to understand the probable binding mode.\n",
      "The molecular dynamics simulations of the apo and holo states of ER and KR showed stable backbone root mean square deviation trajectories with minimal deviation.\n",
      "Ramachandran plot analysis showed 96.0% of residues in the most favorable region for ER and 90.3% for the KR domain, respectively.\n",
      "Thus, the predicted models yielded significant insights into the substrate binding modes of the ER and KR catalytic domains and will aid in identifying novel chemical inhibitors of human FASN that target these domains.\n",
      "Fatty acid synthase (FASN, E.C.\n",
      "2.3.1.85) is a multi-enzyme complex that synthesizes endogenous fatty acids.\n",
      "Seven cycles of FASN-catalyzed reactions result in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into 16-carbon palmitate [1, 2] by the successive addition of 2-carbon units per synthesis cycle.\n",

      "Two major forms of FASN are known: FASN type I (FASNI) and type II.\n",
      "FASNI is a multimeric multi-enzyme complex involved in the synthesis of palmitate in an integrative manner on a single polypeptide chain (α) or on two different polypeptides (α and β).\n",
      "FASNI is further subdivided into two subtypes.\n",
      "Animal FASN, which is a homodimeric protein (α2), is arranged head to tail [3], and the microbial subgroup FASN, which is an oligomer of higher order, consists of certain bacterial FASN type I α6 hexamers and of fungal α6β6 dodecomers [4].\n",
      "Type II FASN consists of independent proteins that catalyze individual reactions and is present in bacteria, plants, and eukaryotic mitochondria [5].\n",
      "Besides the important biochemical role that FASN plays in lipid biogenesis, this complex enzyme has been implicated in several pathological conditions.\n",
      "In comparison with normal cells, the overexpression of FASN has been reported in several types of cancers, including prostrate, breast, ovarian, and colon cancers [6, 7, 8], which strongly suggests the involvement of FASN in cancer progression.\n",
      "Similarly, FASN overexpression in ocular cancer and retinoblastoma and its potential as an anti-cancer target using enzyme inhibitors have been reported from our lab [9].\n",
      "FASN is also indicated to have a potential role in the clinical management of microbial infections, obesity, and diabetes.\n",
      "This enzyme is a potential target to control bacterial infections by using agents, such as cerulenin and triclosan [10], and an anti-tumor target against different cancers [11] and is also targeted for the treatment of obesity [12, 13] and diabetes [14, 15].\n",
      "It is therefore important to understand the structure of this multi-enzyme protein in order to suitably target its various catalytic domains.\n",
      "The resulting ligands could be potential therapeutic leads.\n",
      "In this study, we have attempted to predict the 3D structure of the enoyl reductase (ER) and KR domains of human FASN in unbound form by comparative modeling.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pathogenic bacteria survive in iron-limited host environments by using several iron acquisition mechanisms.\n",
      "Acinetobacter baumannii, causing serious infections in compromised patients, produces an iron-chelating molecule, called acinetobactin, which is composed of equimolar quantities of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), L-threonine, and N-hydroxyhistamine, to compete with host cells for iron.\n",
      "Genes that are involved in the production and transport of acinetobactin are clustered within the genome of A. baumannii.\n",
      "A recent study showed that entA, located outside of the acinetobactin gene cluster, plays important roles in the biosynthesis of the acinetobactin precursor DHBA and in bacterial pathogenesis.\n",
      "Therefore, understanding the genes that are associated with the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin in the bacterial genome is required.\n",
      "This review is intended to provide a general overview of the genes in the genome of A. baumannii that are required for acinetobactin biosynthesis and transport.\n",
      "Iron is one of the essential nutrients for host and pathogenic bacteria, and both require the metal as a cofactor or as a prosthetic group for biologically important proteins that are involved in many basic cellular functions [1].\n",
      "Most iron in the mammalian host is sequestered and bound to high-affinity iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and ferritin, or complexed to the heme of hemoproteins [2].\n",
      "Hence, iron is rarely found as free iron in the mammalian host and is one of the major limiting factors of pathogenic bacteria.\n",
      "Therefore, pathogenic bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for the acquisition of iron from host tissues because of the limited availability of iron to the bacteria and the inevitable competition with the host [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\n",
      "Siderophores are high-affinity iron-chelating compounds secreted by pathogenic bacteria [3].\n",
      "Siderophores are classified into three major groups-catecholates, hydroxamates, and carboxylates-by the ligands that are used to chelate the ferric iron [7].\n",
      "The diversity of siderophores may have resulted from evolutionary pressure, causing the bacteria to produce structurally different siderophores that can not be transported by specific transport systems of other bacteria.\n",
      "For example, Escherichia coli produces a prototype catechol siderophore, which is a cyclic trimer of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-L-serine [5].\n",
      "In comparison, vibriobactin, produced by Vibrio cholera, is a non-cyclic derivative of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) [9].\n",
      "Genes that are involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of siderophores are often clustered within the bacterial genome, and their products are closely linked to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria.\n",
      "Like the pathogenesis of many other bacteria, the pathogenesis of Acinetobacter baumannii, a major opportunistic pathogen that causes serious diseases in compromised patients, including pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, sepsis, and meningitis [10, 11], depends primarily on the organism's ability to uptake and utilize iron [12, 13, 14].\n",
      "Numerous studies have investigated the response of various A. baumannii isolates in iron-limited conditions and identified several gene clusters that are required for the synthesis and transport of siderophores [15].\n",
      "Especially, the acinetobactin-mediated iron acquisition system has been the most extensively characterized system in A. baumannii [16, 17].\n",
      "Acinetobactin, a catechol-hydroxamate siderophore, which is a non-cyclic derivative of DHBA that is linked to threonine and N-hydroxyhistamine, is produced and utilized by three putative systems encoded within the acinetobactin gene cluster of A. baumannii.\n",
      "Moreover, A. baumannii strains have significant genetic diversity in the numbers and types of these iron uptake and utilization systems [15].\n",
      "Therefore, these results indicate that genetic diversity in acinetobactin gene clusters could be a major factor in determining the virulence among A. baumannii strains.\n",
      "In this review, we describe a gene cluster in the genome of A. baumannii that is involved in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin.\n",
      "Furthermore, we present the genetic diversity of the gene cluster that is responsible for acinetobactin biosynthesis and transport in different A. baumannii strains.\n",
      "A. baumannii express high-affinity iron acquisition systems, such as siderophores, to survive under iron-limited host environments.\n",
      "The iron acquisition system that is mediated by the siderophore acinetobactin has been extensively characterized in A. baumannii.\n",
      "Especially, the gene cluster involved in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin has been found in various clinical isolates of A. baumannii, except A. baumannii SDF [15].\n",
      "Acinetobactin is synthesized from a DHBA, threonine, and hydroxyhistamine via proteins encoded by genes within the gene cluster.\n",
      "The mixed-type siderophore, which consists of catecholate and hydroxamate groups, exhibits high affinity for iron [16, 17].\n",
      "Particularly, it has been found that 18 coding regions in the chromosome of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 are required for acinetobactin biosynthesis and the uptake of ferric-acinetobactin complexes [15, 18].\n",
      "The acinetobactin gene cluster of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 is illustrated in Fig.1.\n",
      "The acinetobactin-mediated iron acquisition system is composed of three putative systems encoded within the acinetobactin cluster.\n",
      "First, the biosynthesis of acinetobactin is accomplished by the proteins encoded by basA, basB, basC, basD, basF, basG, basH, basI, and basJ [14, 15].\n",
      "Second, the acinetobactin that is produced by A. baumannii is secreted via a siderophore efflux system of the ABC superfamily, consisting of the proteins encoded by barA and barB [18].\n",
      "Finally, ferric-acinetobactin complexes move into bacterial cells via a receptor for ferric-acinetobactin complexes, consisting of the proteins encoded by bauA, bauB, bauC, bauD, bauE, and bauF [14].\n",
      "Especially, bauB, bauC, bauD, and bauE play important roles in the translocation of ferric-acinetobactin complexes into bacterial cells [15].\n",
      "In addition, putative binding sites for ferric uptake regulator, which controls bacterial iron homeostasis, exist in the upstream regions of basJ, entE/basD, basA/bauF, and bauD/basD.\n",
      "All of these genes that are involved in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin are significantly up-regulated under iron-limited conditions [15].\n",
      "Particularly, a functional analysis of basD, bauA, and bauD mutants under iron-limited conditions showed that iron acquisition that is mediated by the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin is essential for the survival of A. baumannii under iron-limited conditions [13].\n",
      "Moreover, a recent study by Gaddy et al.\n",
      "[13] indicated that BasD and BauA play important roles in the persistence of infection by A. baumannii within epithelial cells and their apoptotic death.\n",
      "The results obtained from a mouse sepsis model also showed that the acinetobactin-mediated iron acquisition system is a major factor in the pathogenesis of A. baumannii, such as the establishment of bacterial infection and cell damage.\n",
      "Especially, impairment of BasD production resulted in an intermediate virulence phenotype in ex vivo and in vivo infection models in comparison to those of the parental strain and bauA mutant.\n",
      "These results represent that both acinetobactin synthesis and uptake of iron-acinetobactin complexes are absolutely required for the pathogenesis of A. baumannii.\n",
      "Penwell et al.\n",
      "[18] described that the gene cluster that is involved in acinetobactin production and its utilization exists in the chromosomes of different A. baumannii strains.\n",
      "In addition, the gene cluster is found in A. baumannii AYE, which is a natural entA mutant incapable of producing acinetobactin [18, 19].\n",
      "However, the cognate clusters in the A. baumannii AB0057 and ACICU strains contain the additional putative genes AB57_2807 and AB57_2818 [20], and ACICU_02575 and ACICU_02586 [21], respectively (Fig.1).\n",
      "In the case of A. baumannii AB307-294, three additional predicted genes, ABBFA_001054, ABBFA_001053, and ABBFA_001065, are also added in the bas-bau-bar gene cluster (Fig.1) [20].\n",
      "Although the functions of these additional genes in siderophore production and its utilization are not characterized, these results indicate the possibility that genetic diversity in acinetobactin gene clusters could be closely linked to the virulence of A. baumannii.\n",
      "Enterobactin that is produced by E. coli is a high-affinity siderophore for iron [5].\n",
      "In the enterobactin biosynthesis, chorismic acid is converted to DHBA by the products of entA, entB, and entC.\n",
      "An amide linkage of DHBA to L-serine (Ser) is then catalyzed by the proteins encoded by entD, entE, entF, and entB.\n",
      "The molecules of the DHBA-Ser that is formed undergo intermolecular cyclization, yielding enterobactin.\n",
      "A. baumannii also employs basF and basJ within the acinetobactin gene cluster, which are homologs of entC and entB, respectively, to produce mature acinetobactin [18].\n",
      "However, entA has not been found in the acinetobactin gene cluster.\n",
      "Recently, it was found that a single functional copy of an entA ortholog is located in anupstream region of the modE-modA-modB-modC gene cluster that is required for the molybdenum transport system in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (Fig.2) [18].\n",
      "In particular, a functional analysis based on gene cloning and biochemical tests showed that entA is absolutely required for the production of DHBA, which is used by A. baumannii as a precursor for acinetobactin biosynthesis.\n",
      "The study also demonstrated that acinetobactin intermediates and DHBA play important roles in the virulence of A. baumannii in ex vivo and in vivo infection models.\n",
      "Even though entA is found outside of the acinetobactin cluster in A. baumannii strains, the genetic contents surrounding the entA gene are variable among different clinical isolates [18].\n",
      "For example, the entA gene of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 is next to the coding regions of the mod gene cluster (Fig.2).\n",
      "However, the entA gene of A. baumannii ATCC 17978 is situated within a large gene cluster that encodes an uncharacterized siderophore-mediated system (Fig.2).\n",
      "Especially, this cluster, in which mobile DNA elements exist, is flanked by inverted repeats, a feature that can explain its transfer by lateral processes.\n",
      "Therefore, these results represent that genetic components that are required for iron acquisition via the acinetobactin-mediated system give rise to horizontal gene transfer with complex chromosomal rearrangement processes.\n",
      "Consequently, the newly added siderophore gene cluster with the entA gene via horizontal gene transfer may cause these two strains, ATCC 19606 and ATCC 17978, to acquire iron via different siderophore-mediated systems from different sources.\n",
      "The possibility was proven by a genomic analysis of fully sequenced and annotated A. baumannii isolates [15, 19].\n",
      "Four siderophore gene clusters are newly predicted to be involved in siderophore production and the uptake of iron-siderophore complexes (Table 1).\n",
      "Cluster 1 is indicated in the genomes of all strains analyzed, with the exception of A. baumannii 8399.\n",
      "Cluster 2 and cluster 4 are found only in A. baumannii ATCC 17978 and isolate 8399, respectively.\n",
      "Cluster 5 is present in all genomes analyzed except for that of A. baumannii ATCC 17978.\n",
      "The possibility is also supported by the result that the iron uptake phenotype of the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 basD mutant was not different from that of the parental 17978 strain when compared under iron-limited conditions.\n",
      "A. baumannii employs specialized systems that are required for iron acquisition in iron-limited host environments [16].\n",
      "In this review, we described the genes of A. baumannii that are involved in acinetobactin biosynthesis and transport.\n",
      "A number of studies have identified the genes that are essential for iron acquisition [13, 15, 16, 17].\n",
      "Especially, the data presented in this review indicate that A. baumannii strains have genetic diversity in the acinetobacter gene cluster.\n",
      "Even though the roles of the additional genes in acinetobactin cluster in different.\n",
      "A. baumannii strains are not characterized, we suggest that the genes could be associated with A. baumannii virulence.\n",
      "Therefore, functional analysis of the genes in the bacteria is required.\n",
      "Furthermore, we showed both a single entA functional ortholog and variability in the bacterial genome.\n",
      "Therefore, we suggest that A. baumannii has continuously evolved the iron acquisition mechanism, which is associated with acinetobactin from different sources by horizontal gene transfer.\n",

      "With the emergence of large datasets in biology, life scientists are encountering bottlenecks in handling the biological data.\n",
      "This study presents an integrated geographic information system (GIS)-ontology application for handling microbial genome data.\n",
      "The application uses a linear referencing technique as one of the GIS functionalities to represent genes as linear events on the genome layer, where users can define/change the attributes of genes in an event table and interactively see the gene events on a genome layer.\n",
      "Our application adopted ontology to portray and store genomic data in a semantic framework, which facilitates data-sharing among biology domains, applications, and experts.\n",
      "The application was developed in two steps.\n",
      "In the first step, the genome annotated data were prepared and stored in a MySQL database.\n",
      "The second step involved the connection of the database to both ArcGIS and Protégé as the GIS engine and ontology platform, respectively.\n",
      "We have designed this application specifically to manage the genome-annotated data of rumen microbial populations.\n",
      "Such a GIS-ontology application offers powerful capabilities for visualizing, managing, reusing, sharing, and querying genome-related data.\n",
      "The advances in genomics technologies and other molecular research, together with recent developments in information technologies, have generated a great quantity of data in the molecular biology domain [1].\n",
      "For example, GenBank, as a comprehensive and well-known database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) online resources, holds nucleotide sequences for more than 280,000 species that are available to the public [2].\n",
      "Another example of large biological datasets is the 2013 edition of the annual Nucleic Acids Research database issue, which currently lists 1,512 databases, organized into 14 categories and 41 subcategories, available at http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/ [3].\n",
      "Among organisms, rumen microbes have not been an exception to these debates.\n",
      "But, much less attention has been paid to integrate and manage the genomic data related to these microorganisms.\n",
      "Molecular research on ruminal microbes has gained attention as more genomic sequences and related genomic data are becoming available to scientific communities.\n",
      "The primary focus of this study was to develop an application that allows users to interactively manage the genome-annotated data of rumen microbial consortia.\n",
      "The rumen environment is the main part of the digestive system and consists of a complex microbial community that makes the rumen microbial ecosystem [4].\n",
      "This ecosystem is a natural habitat that houses a wide spectrum of bacteria, protozoa, anaerobic fungi, and bacteriophages [5].\n",
      "By having a symbiotic mutualistic relationship with ruminants, the microbes are capable of converting feed components into a source of energy for the animals (i.e., volatile fatty acids).\n",
      "Ruminants are able to utilize a variety of feeds owing to an extremely diversified rumen microbial ecosystem [4].\n",
      "According to previous molecular studies, it has been reported that the population of rumen bacteria accounts for at least 300 to 400 phylotypes [6,7,8].\n",
      "There is no doubt that progress in biological research could not be achieved without equivalent efforts in informatics research.\n",
      "Since data management and analysis are facing new challenges in parallel with the age of big data, many research activities have been conducted for handling the biological data.\n",
      "There are several special issues that reflect the ever increasing importance of data management approaches in biology [9,10,11,12,13].\n",
      "Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based system designed for displaying, storing, manipulating, and analyzing geographical data [14].\n",
      "As an analytical system, GIS can serve biological systems by establishing biological databases, with the use of powerful representation and display tools, as well as providing query and analysis tools.\n",
      "An example of a GIS query is finding all hospitals that are equipped with an advanced technology, located in the city center, and with more than 500 beds.\n",
      "A number of GIS-based approaches have been used to handle biological information.\n",
      "A typical example in the biology domain is discussed by Kozak et al.\n",
      "[15], in which they applied GIS technologies and concepts for evolutionary biology.\n",
      "Their study uses the GIS to track macroevolutionary changes among species and the evolutionary process of geographic variation within species.\n",
      "In previous studies of GIS applications in genomics, a major effort was made by Dolan et al.[16].\n",
      "They presented a GIS application, called Genome Spatial Information System (GenoSIS), to manage and represent genomic information.\n",
      "Ontology is about terminology (domain vocabulary), all essential concepts in a domain, their classification, taxonomy, relations (including all important hierarchies and constraints), and domain axioms [17].\n",
      "It represents the particular meanings of concepts by specifying the concepts and their relationships.\n",
      "The use of ontology enables one to structure biological data (genome/gene data) in a machine-understandable form by defining biological concepts, relationships, and instances in a semantic structure.\n",
      "This paper presents an integrated GIS-ontology application for the management of microbial genome data.\n",
      "The main rationale behind integrating GIS and ontology is that these two distinct areas of research can complement each other for biological applications.\n",
      "While the GIS is commonly recognized as a powerful and integrated tool with unique capabilities for storing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geographical information, ontology provides a rich collection of procedures and algorithms to meaningfully share and exchange data.\n",
      "Our application is implemented by using ArcGIS and Protégé to couple GIS-based biological applications with ontology.\n",
      "The genome-annotated data of rumen microbial flora were adopted to evaluate the performance of the application.\n",
      "The system can be extended and employed for handling other types of genomic data.\n",
      "More specifically, this study adopts the functionality of linear referencing (LR) for representing genome-annotated data in a GIS environment.\n",
      "Our application uses ontology to semantically organize and reason the data in a semantic and machine-understandable framework.\n",
      "In this application, we defined a measurement unit for genomes, so that one meter was assigned per nucleotide.\n",
      "The users have the flexibility to interact with the genome as a layer or with different genomes as a collection of layers.\n",
      "The ArcGIS platform of the application supports users with interactive genomic maps and implementation of special queries.\n",
      "Title: Linear referencing\n",
      "\n",
      "LR is one of the GIS tools representing geographic locations of linear events based on relative positions on linear features [18], where the beginning and end of the events are recorded as measurement values in event tables.\n",
      "Using LR, attributes are linearly referenced and linked dynamically to layers (e.g., the genome).\n",
      "This technique can be effectively used to represent genomes and genes as layers and linear events, respectively.\n",
      "By applying this technique, the genomic data initially stored in event tables can be visualized, displayed, queried, and analyzed on the genome network.\n",
      "The LR method provides flexibility to split a linear genome into new sets of gene segments (i.e., line events), without having to draw a new line layer for gene events.\n",
      "As presented in Fig.1, the LR process includes the fields of location and attribute(s) associated with gene events.\n",
      "As shown, the line gene events are related to the genome layers through the values of the field \"Genome-ID.\"\n",
      "The location of line events (genes) on a given genome layer is indicated in the fields \"Start\" and \"End.\"\n",
      "In other words, a line event uses both \"Start\" and \"End\" measure values to describe a portion (i.e., a gene) of a genome.\n",
      "Title: Ontology\n",
      "\n",
      "From a computer science perspective, ontology is defined as the structure representing a shared, formal, and explicit specification of knowledge in a particular domain (e.g., biology).\n",
      "Hendler [19] describes ontology as a set of knowledge terms, containing the terminology (domain vocabulary), all essential concepts in the domain, the semantic interconnections, and simple rules of logic and inference for some particular topics.\n",
      "A typical example of an ontology approach in biology is using standard concepts to classify microorganisms.\n",
      "There are a large number of identified microbes in nature, so that this amount has long stimulated interest to establish an anthological classification for them.\n",
      "Gene Ontology (GO) is another example of an ontology application in biology.\n",
      "GO is intended to formulize biological knowledge in orthogonal hierarchies [20].\n",
      "It includes controlled vocabularies that are described for gene products with respect to their biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions [21].\n",
      "Ontology specification languages are knowledge representation languages used to encode ontologies in a formal (machine-readable and -processable) and standard format.\n",
      "The most common and popular ontology language is OWL from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n",
      "OWL concepts/classes (e.g., genome, gene, etc.)\n",
      "are created using formal specifications that an individual object/instance (e.g., genome and gene instances) needs to satisfy to belong to a particular class.\n",
      "The individuals that share similar characteristics would be members of the same concept.\n",
      "Title: Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "As depicted in Fig.2, the ontology-based GIS application was implemented using a combination of the two platforms of ArcGIS [22] and Protégé [23] and MySQL as a database management system.\n",
      "ArcGIS is a commercial software package containing a set of integrated applications, such as ArcMap and ArcCatalog.\n",
      "ArcMap is the main mapping application allowing users to generate maps, query attributes, analyze spatial relationships, and lay out final projects.\n",
      "The ArcCatalog application allows users to manage geographic data [24].\n",
      "Several programs have been developed to edit and view ontologies, such as Ontolingua and Protégé.\n",
      "Both Ontolingua and Protégé are capable of generating a separate frame for every knowledge item that covers the information, such as definitions, links, and relationships [20].\n",
      "In the proposed application, we applied the Protégé software as an ontology-developing environment.\n",
      "Protégé is a free and open-source platform that provides a set of tools for constructing domain ontologies and knowledge-based applications.\n",
      "We constructed the rumen microbial genome ontology to organize genome-related data, including classes (e.g., microbial genomes found in rumen and their associated genes) and their relationships/properties (e.g., gene name, product, catalyzed reaction, and accession number of a gene).\n",
      "In order to implement the system, we applied the genome-annotated data of several ruminal microbes deposited in NCBI.\n",
      "In the first phase of implementation, the genome-annotated data were stored in a MySQL database using Navicat software (Fig.3).\n",
      "Navicat, as a powerful solution for MySQL administration, offers a graphical interface for managing databases (http://navicat.com/).\n",
      "The second phase involved the connection of the database to both ArcGIS and Protégé as the GIS engine and ontology platform, respectively.\n",
      "The database was connected to the ArcCatalog application of ArcGIS.\n",
      "The genome layers were created as shapefiles via ArcCatalog and displayed in an ArcMap environment (Fig.4).\n",
      "As shown in Fig.5, the DataMaster plugin of Protégé was integrated with a MySQL database through a JDBC driver.\n",
      "DataMaster is a plugin for Protégé editor that allows the conversion of a relational database into an RDF model (resource descriptive framework) that can be processed and understood by machines [25].\n",
      "After integrating DataMaster with the MySQL database, each of the tables from the database was imported into Protégé as an OWL class, along with its instances and properties.\n",
      "One of the advantages of a GIS application in the genomic area is that users can easily query and analyze genome-related data.\n",
      "In addition, the users are able to select locations on a genome map and display their records in the attribute table.\n",
      "GIS has a special functionality to support users with simple and complex queries for the data represented in each layer.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.6, complicated queries were made based on the attributes of genomic data and a given gene location.\n",
      "Fig.6 presents two query examples: one is for a special gene product (phosphoglucosamine mutase) in the annotated genome of Streptococcus bovis, and another is a query based on a specific accession number belonging to the gene (genes).\n",
      "The results of both query examples are presented on the genome, such that they are highlighted with a red rectangle on the genome layer.\n",
      "ArcGIS allows one to use \"Identify tool.\"\n",
      "Applying this tool allows users to be able to have information about a gene displayed in ArcMap.\n",
      "It has been used as the fastest way to find out the characteristics of a location on a map.\n",
      "On the gene event layer, users are able to identify genes by clicking on a particular location (Fig.7).\n",
      "This will present the attribute data of the selected location.\n",
      "The genome ontology of ruminal microbes was developed using OWL/RDF language in the Protégé environment.\n",
      "Fig.8 shows a screenshot of Protégé's class tab, indicated by a red rectangle.\n",
      "Via this tab, classes, along with their subclasses for the ontology, are displayed in the blue rectangle, and all instances and their attributes are shown in yellow and green rectangles, respectively.\n",
      "Additional tabs for object properties and data type properties are available in the editor, which has the same view as the class tab.\n",
      "In conclusion, the proposed application provides users with the ability to manage genomic data related to the microbial community of the rumen.\n",
      "This application will be particularly helpful to researchers and experts who are working in fields, such as biology, animal sciences, and genomics.\n",
      "Two central aspects of designing and using such an interactive application are data querying and data sharing.\n",
      "The application allows users (1) to access, visualize, store, query, and analyze the genomic data and (2) to share such data among biology users and applications by providing a semantic structure of data.\n",
      "The data stored in the ontology is machine-processable and can be shared and reused by biology applications.\n",
      "With the emergence of large datasets in biology, life scientists are encountering bottlenecks in handling biological data.\n",
      "The increase of genomic data caused by next-generation sequencing technologies is leading to a continuous decrease in the effectiveness of conventional genomic browsers [26].\n",
      "Most genomic browsers are principally used for visualizing the genomic features and a user's genomic data [26].\n",
      "In order to visualize genomic features, different genomic browsers are available on the web, such as Ensembl [27] and University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) [28].\n",
      "Some genomic browsers represent gene annotations as horizontal data tracks.\n",
      "For example, the UCSC genomic browser represents annotations as a series of horizontal tracks over the genomic sequence.\n",
      "In this browser, each track presents a specific type of annotation [28].\n",
      "In comparison to the paradigm of horizontal data tracks applied by genomic browsers, the GIS application uses the concepts of a LR technique to present genomes in a dynamic manner, where users can define/change attributes of genes in a table and interactively see the gene events on genome layers.\n",
      "A previous study of a GIS application in genomic data management employed the concepts and tools that were defined for displaying the geographic data to develop GenoSIS.\n",
      "GenoSIS was proposed to spatially represent genomes and interact with genome-related attribute data [16].\n",
      "However, this system is based on a fixed linear data model, which presents the genome as a linear feature with associated attributes.\n",
      "The system is fixed in the sense that defining new or changing gene attributes requires users to graphically draw new lines and change the GIS file (i.e., genome shapefile and geodatabase file).\n",
      "Moreover, this system lacks the ability to semantically represent genome-related information, where information can meaningfully be interpreted by software agents and can be shared between different biological applications.\n",
      "One of the most interesting capabilities of GIS compared to existing genomic browsers is its ability to make complex attribute and spatial queries.\n",
      "A GIS query is a user-defined request that examines genome/gene layer or tabular attributes based on user-selected criteria and displays only those features or records that satisfy the criteria.\n",
      "The proposed application has the potential to store, represent, visualize, and analyze genome-annotated data in a dynamic manner.\n",
      "In addition, our application adopted ontology to organize genomic data in a semantic framework, which facilitates data sharing among biology domains, applications, and experts.\n",
      "During recent years, there have been many web-based developments that use ontology as their knowledge base, such as GO [21], Plant Ontology [29], and Microbial Ontology [30], etc.\n",
      "Ontologies define domain concepts and the relationships between them and therefore provide a domain language that is meaningful to both machines and humans [30].\n",
      "In the present study, we used Protégé, which contains a query interface known as the SPARQL query panel, through which users are able to query particular information from the ontology [30].\n",
      "However, the proposed application in this study is subject to some limitations.\n",
      "One of the limitations is that the application is not able to represent all genomic data (e.g., sequences) and can not make a query on several genome event layers simultaneously.\n",
      "Another limitation is related to the lack of powerful inference engines to reason genomic data for the purpose of data sharing.\n",
      "Effective inference engines are required to semantically interpret data and exchange them with their intended meanings.\n",
      "One source of limitation is also related to the fact that the application is available on desktop; future research is required to develop an online version of the application and a data server consisting of microbial genome databases for browsing genome-annotated data.\n",
      "Our work continues toward future plans, including the extension of this application to develop an ontology-based GIS interactive database for rumen microbial communities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since the advent of next-generation sequencing, we have realized that a substantial amount of the human genome, not just the 2% to 5% of the human genome that is occupied by coding genes, is transcribed, which means that there is a substantial amount of non-protein-coding RNAs in the human genome.\n",
      "Non-coding RNAs are RNA transcripts that are not translated into proteins; some of them play a role in the regulation of gene expression and will be eventually implicated in on diverse diseases, including cancer.\n",
      "In this issue, Dr. Yong Sun Lee (University of Texas) reviewed the implications of a novel type of non-coding RNA, nc886, which was recently discovered by his group.\n",
      "nc886 is known to have putative tumor suppressor and tumor-sensing functions.\n",
      "In this review, the characteristics and roles of this ncRNA in tumorigenesis are introduced.\n",
      "Dr. Namshin Kim's group (KOBIC) reported the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of sequence variants for clinical use.\n",
      "They suggested the optimal sequencing depth for defining most diverse function-related variants, which would be useful for next-generation sequencing based biomedical research and clinical translation.\n",
      "Dr. Jung Kyoon Choi's group (KAIST) investigated how transcription and epigenetic processes are genetically regulated and associated with each other.\n",
      "For this purpose, they examined the changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in response to genetic variation by means of quantitative trait loci mapping.\n",
      "In addition, there are three articles on in silico modeling.\n",
      "Title: A Novel Type of Non-coding RNA, nc886, Implicated in Tumor Sensing and Suppression\n",
      "\n",
      "nc886 (=vtRNA2-1, pre-miR-886, or CBL3) is a newly identified non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that represses the activity of protein kinase R (PKR).\n",
      "nc886 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and is intriguingly the first case of a Pol III gene whose expression is silenced by CpG DNA hypermethylation in several types of cancer.\n",
      "PKR is a sensor protein that recognizes evading viruses and induces apoptosis to eliminate infected cells.\n",
      "Like viral infection, nc886 silencing activates PKR and induces apoptosis.\n",
      "Thus, the significance of the nc886:PKR pathway in cancer is to sense and eliminate pre-malignant cells, which is analogous to PKR's role in cellular innate immunity.\n",
      "Beyond this tumor sensing role, nc886 plays a putative tumor suppressor role as supported by experimental evidence.\n",
      "Collectively, nc886 provides a novel example how epigenetic silencing of a ncRNA contributes to tumorigenesis by controlling the activity of its protein ligand.\n",
      "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are defined as RNA transcripts that are not translated into proteins.\n",
      "Classically, only a limited number of RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs, were perceived as ncRNAs.\n",
      "However, this view changed completely after in-depth analysis of mammalian transcriptomes (reviewed in Mattick and Makunin [1]).\n",
      "A decade ago, the advent of next generation sequencing and high-resolution genome tiling arrays revealed that up to 70% of the human genome is transcribed but only about 2% is occupied by protein-coding regions.\n",
      "Moreover, some ncRNAs were found to play regulatory roles for gene expression, as compared to classical ncRNAs that play housekeeping roles.\n",
      "So, ncRNAs are much more dominant in quantity and more diverse in function, than they were thought before.\n",
      "These regulatory ncRNAs have been a topic of intense study during the last decade.\n",
      "So far, most regulatory ncRNAs bind to target genes via nucleic acid interaction to serve as a specificity factor to recruit effector proteins (Fig.1).\n",
      "For example, nuclear ncRNAs recruit chromatin remodeling factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) recruit the mRNA-slicing complex (reviewed in Fatica and Bozzoni [2] and Filipowicz et al.[3]).\n",
      "Our laboratory has recently discovered a ncRNA that functions in a completely different way and we named it nc886 [45].\n",
      "nc886's function is to bind to a protein and control its activity, rather than to recognize target DNA or RNA.\n",
      "Here, a summary of its characteristics and roles in cancer will be reviewed.\n",
      "nc886 has been given several names, including vtRNA2-1, CBL3, and pre-miR-886.\n",
      "vtRNA2-1 is currently its official name and stands for vault RNA 2-1 [6].\n",
      "The vault RNAs (vtRNAs) are the RNA components in the vault complex, a large ribonucleoprotein particle whose precise function has not been elucidated yet (reviewed in Berger et al.[7]).\n",
      "In the human genome, there are three canonical vtRNA genes, vtRNA1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. nc886 was thought to be a vtRNA paralog because of sequence homology and therefore was named vtRNA2-1 [6].\n",
      "However, nc886 is less similar in sequence to canonical vtRNAs than they are similar to each other [5].\n",
      "Furthermore, nc886 is neither in physical association with the vault complex nor necessary for the integrity of the complex [5].\n",
      "nc886 is functionally distinct from vtRNA1-1 [458910].\n",
      "Another alias for nc886, CBL3, stands for cord blood lymphocyte (CBL)-derived ncRNA 3.\n",
      "This name originated from the fact that nc886 was one of the most induced ncRNAs when CBL was infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [11].\n",
      "Interestingly, canonical vtRNAs were also induced by EBV, which also contributed to the early misconception of nc886 as a vtRNA [12].\n",
      "In addition, nc886 was once classified as a miRNA precursor and so was registered in the miRNA database (miRBase: http://www.mirbase.org/) [13].\n",
      "This was due to the high sensitivity of the next-generation sequencing technologies, together with the high intracellular expression level of nc886 but its short half-life [5].\n",
      "Thus, its degradation products are continuously produced at a quantity high enough to be captured by small RNA sequencing.\n",
      "According to the deepBase (http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/) where small RNA sequencing data were collected and displayed [14], the nc886 sequence was captured at significantly higher frequency than most other genomic regions.\n",
      "In addition, 20-30 nucleotides at the 5'- and 3'-end of nc886 were captured more prominently than its middle portion.\n",
      "This sequencing pattern misinterpreted as each end corresponding to mature miR-886-5p and -3p respectively.\n",
      "However, our extensive analysis proved that it is not a miRNA precursor.\n",
      "First and foremost, nc886 appears as a single band at 101 nucleotides (nts) in Northern hybridization [458910].\n",
      "Second, the biogenesis of nc886 is dissimilar to that of miRNAs; nc886 is neither processed from Drosha cleavage nor diced into mature miRNAs by Dicer [5].\n",
      "Third, there is no inverse correlation in expression between nc886 and the predicted target genes of miR-886-5p or -3p, which is against our expectation if nc886 would to produce functional mature miRNAs [5].\n",
      "Since nc886 does not produce a miRNA precursor nor is in the vault complex, its aliases pre-miR-886 and vtRNA2-1 are misleading.\n",
      "Therefore, our research group renamed it non-coding 886 (nc886) [4] and this name will be used throughout the review.\n",
      "Whereas many other regulatory ncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Fig.1), nc886 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) as evidenced by its sequence and experimental data.\n",
      "nc886 contains the well-conserved Pol III promoter elements Box A and B followed by an oligo-dT sequence, which is a Pol III termination signal (red colors in Fig.2).\n",
      "The actual occupation of Pol III on the nc886 genomic region was consistently shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by ultra-high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq data) from several research groups [151617].\n",
      "It is generally thought that Pol III activity is elevated in cancer [18].\n",
      "In agreement with this idea, the nc886 expression level is high in many cancer cells relative to normal tissues (YSL, unpublished data) [5].\n",
      "On the contrary, nc886 expression is silenced by CpG DNA hypermethylation in many malignancies [891920].\n",
      "Methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the most common type of epigenetic modification of the mammalian genomic DNA (reviewed in Klose and Bird [21]).\n",
      "Some genes have CpG islands, which are blocks of sequence where CpG dinucleotides are enriched and located mostly in the promoter region.\n",
      "Hypermethylation in CpG islands represses gene transcription and this is one of the most frequent ways that tumor suppressor genes are silenced in cancer.\n",
      "Noticeably, the genomic region of nc886 has a CpG island (blue bar in Fig.2).\n",
      "Many studies, done mostly on protein-coding genes transcribed by Pol II, indicate that chromatin remodeling is the prevalent mechanism by which CpG methylation silences gene expression.\n",
      "However, CpG methylation has barely been examined in ncRNA genes transcribed by Pol III.\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, nc886 is the first and so far only case of a Pol III transcript that is silenced by CpG hypermethylation in cancer.\n",
      "So, nc886 should serve as an ideal model gene for studying a mechanism for epigenetic regulation of Pol III transcription.\n",
      "nc886 is encoded on human chromosome 5q31 and its locus is flanked by transforming growth factor β-induced (TGFBI) and SMAD5, both of which are implicated in the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway (Fig.2).\n",
      "Although this suggests a possible co-regulation of nc886 with these two genes, it is interesting to consider the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a barrier protein blocking the spread of heterochromatin (reviewed in Ong and Corces [22]).\n",
      "ChIP-seq data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) indicate that there are two CTCF binding sites at each side of the nc886 region (brown bars in Fig.2), suggesting that the chromatin status of nc886 is being insulated by CTCF.\n",
      "According to our unpublished data, nc886 seemed to be co-regulated with its flanking genes in some cancer cells but not in others.\n",
      "Given the established role of the TGF-β signaling in cancer, it will be interesting to investigate the involvement of TGF-β in the regulation of nc886/TGFBI/SMAD5 expression.\n",
      "As aforementioned, nc886 is a molecular switch for a protein to modulate its activity.\n",
      "That protein is protein kinase R (PKR).\n",
      "PKR is an interferon-inducible, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase that senses viral infection in the cellular cytoplasm (reviewed in Garcia et al.[23]).\n",
      "The PKR signaling pathway is very complicated: it is activated by several other stresses besides viral infection and its activation affects many downstream pathways.\n",
      "Elaboration on the whole PKR pathway is beyond the scope of this review, but here a very brief introduction only about relevant parts will be provided.\n",
      "Upon viral infection, the classical PKR pathway begins with its binding to virus-derived dsRNA that activates PKR and subsequently its downstream events, including (1) phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α subunit (eIF2α) to block global protein synthesis and (2) activation of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (nuclear factor κB [NF-κB]).\n",
      "The PKR:eIF2α branch leads to apoptosis and this explains how mammalian organisms eliminate virally-infected cells.\n",
      "In contrast, the PKR:NF-κB branch is usually considered to be pro-survival.\n",
      "Besides the innate immune response, numerous papers have also documented PKR's role in cancer in the absence of viral infection.\n",
      "Along with its two opposite functions through eIF2α and NF-κB, both tumor suppressive and oncogenic roles for PKR have been reported in cancer (reviewed in Marchal et al.[24]).\n",
      "nc886 binds to PKR with an affinity comparable to dsRNA and prevents PKR from being activated, in contrast to the PKR-activating ligand dsRNA [458910].\n",
      "One reason for these contradictory outcomes between nc886 and dsRNA is their difference in length.\n",
      "dsRNA is long enough to accommodate PKR dimerization which is a necessary step for its autophosphorylation and subsequent activation (Fig.3).\n",
      "nc886 at 101 nts long is probably too short for two PKR molecules to bind.\n",
      "When nc886 is ectopically expressed, it attenuates dsRNA-mediated PKR activation [10].\n",
      "Notably, knockdown of nc886 is sufficient for PKR activation in the absence of dsRNA [4589], indicating that human PKR has an intrinsic tendency to self-activate and so needs a repressor to avoid its aberrant activation.\n",
      "In summary, nc886 is a PKR inhibitor.\n",
      "Both knockdown of nc886 and introduction of dsRNA activate PKR (Fig.3).\n",
      "nc886 silencing does occur during tumorigenesis and dsRNA is generated during viral infection.\n",
      "The significance of PKR in viral infection is to sense viruses and remove them by inducing apoptosis through eIF2α phosphorylation.\n",
      "We implanted this scenario in cancer and proposed a tumor surveillance model.\n",
      "In this model, nc886 silencing in pre-malignant cells is sensed by PKR, which eliminates them through eIF2α phosphorylation.\n",
      "Another important point in this model is the escape of viruses or cancer cells from the PKR:eIF2α cell death pathway.\n",
      "Viruses have various strategies to bypass or disarm PKR.\n",
      "Likewise, some potential cancer cells can survive the PKR surveillance through genetic or epigenetic alterations.\n",
      "For an elaborate description on the tumor surveillance model, please read this review [25].\n",
      "In addition to the nc886:PKR pathway in the tumor surveillance, does nc886 silencing play an active role in tumor etiology or progression?\n",
      "Two recent papers have provided several pieces of evidence for nc886 being a putative tumor suppressor [89].\n",
      "First, nc886 expression is suppressed in clinical tumor samples compared to normal tissues, and more importantly, the low expression of nc886 correlates with poor survival of patients.\n",
      "This was seen in paired normal/tumor specimens from 88 gastric cancer (GC) and 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients [89].\n",
      "nc886 expression is also silenced in a number of cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origins, such as esophagus [8], stomach [9], breast (YSL, unpublished data), ovary (YSL, unpublished data), bile duct [4], head and neck, lung, cervix [5], etc.\n",
      "Besides our data, several other research groups have reported that the suppressed expression of nc886 in many different cancer types including lung cancer [192627], thyroid cancer [28], and breast cancer [29].\n",
      "Although these papers claimed that they detected mature miRNAs, miR-886-5p and -3p, nc886 is most probably what they detected, because their detection methods could not efficiently distinguish the mature miRNAs from nc886.\n",
      "Second, the silencing of nc886 RNA expression is caused by CpG hypermethylation, which is one of the most common mechanisms to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in cancer.\n",
      "The significance of nc886 CpG methylation in the prognosis of cancer patients has been proven by our ESCC and GC data [89] as well as other groups' data in lung cancer [19] and acute myeloid leukemia [20].\n",
      "Third, acute depletion of nc886 activates oncogenes.\n",
      "These oncogenes include renowned ones, such as FOS, MYC, MAFB, and ID2, all of which are known to drive cells to malignancy when aberrantly overexpressed [30313233].\n",
      "Also, nc886 depletion activates oncogenic NF-κB in a PKR-dependent manner [489] and in this case PKR acts as an oncogene in the few cells that have survived the nc886: PKR:eIF2α-mediated apoptotic branch.\n",
      "In this context, nc886 is an inhibitor of the PKR oncogene and therefore is a tumor suppressor.\n",
      "Fourth, nc886 is antiproliferative.\n",
      "Ectopic expression of nc886 inhibits growth of several cancer cells [89].\n",
      "This effect is specific, because such toxic effects are seen only in cancer cells that do not express endogenous nc886 but not in non-malignant cells that express endogenous nc886.\n",
      "nc886's antiproliferative role is thought to be, at least partially, through suppressing NF-κB, as supported by our experimental data from cholangiocarcinoma [4].\n",
      "nc886 is a newly discovered ncRNA that controls PKR activity and plays tumor sensing and suppressing roles.\n",
      "nc886's expression pattern and function in tumors opens a possibility that its measurement can be a diagnostic or prognostic marker and its administration into cancer cells can be a therapeutic strategy.\n",
      "Nonetheless, we expect that nc886's role is multifaceted in cancer and may even be oncogenic in certain contexts, because nc886 expression as well as PKR's role can be in two opposite directions in cancer.\n",
      "Also, nc886 is a unique case of a Pol III gene that is epigenetically silenced in cancer and so provides an intriguing model for studying epigenetic regulation of Pol III.\n",

      "Sequencing depth, which is directly related to the cost and time required for the generation, processing, and maintenance of next-generation sequencing data, is an important factor in the practical utilization of such data in clinical fields.\n",
      "Unfortunately, identifying an exome sequencing depth adequate for clinical use is a challenge that has not been addressed extensively.\n",
      "Here, we investigate the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of sequence variants for clinical use.\n",
      "Toward this, we sequenced ten germ-line blood samples from breast cancer patients on the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high depth of ~200×.\n",
      "We observed that most function-related diverse variants in the human exonic regions could be detected at a sequencing depth of 120×.\n",
      "Furthermore, investigation using a diagnostic gene set showed that the number of clinical variants identified using exome sequencing reached a plateau at an average sequencing depth of about 120×.\n",
      "Moreover, the phenomena were consistent across the breast cancer samples.\n",
      "Exome capture sequencing (simply referred to as \"exome sequencing\") is a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based technique which targets the genomic sequences of protein-coding regions (\"exomes\") of a species [1].\n",
      "Although protein-coding regions constitute only 1% of the human genome, they harbor 85% of the mutations that have significant effects on disease-related traits [2].\n",
      "Therefore, exome sequencing is a potential contributor to the understanding of diverse human diseases [2].\n",
      "With a dramatic decrease in the cost and time required for the generation of sequences with high accuracy [3], exome sequencing is now widely used to understand many genetic diseases.\n",
      "For example, in the Netherlands, exome sequencing of ten blood samples from patients with severe intellectual disabilities allowed the identification of five new candidate genes associated with such disabilities [4].\n",
      "Further, Ng et al.\n",
      "[1] sequenced the exomes of twelve human samples with or without Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS), which is a rare dominantly inherited disorder, and observed an association between the MYH3 gene was responsible for FSS.\n",
      "Furthermore, Huh et al.\n",
      "[5] used exome sequencing to show that the c.234 G > A and c.1150C > T mutations in exon 18 of the HGSNAT gene were common in mucopolysaccharide patients.\n",
      "Exome sequencing techniques have also been used to understand the risks of various cancers, including those of the breast [67], prostate [8], pancreas [9], and others [101112].\n",
      "Therefore, exome sequencing techniques have become a new primary paradigm for research on genetic diseases and cancers.\n",
      "One important issue that needs to be addressed for the clinical utilization of NGS-based sequencing data is the adequate depth of sequencing.\n",
      "Sequencing depth is directly related to the cost and time required for the generation, processing, and maintenance of sequencing data [13].\n",
      "In this vein, several studies have been performed to investigate the impact of sequencing depth on NGS data intended to identify genomic variants.\n",
      "For example, Hou et al.\n",
      "[14] investigated the discovery rates of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants in healthy samples using whole genome sequencing (WGS) at an average sequencing depth of 180×.\n",
      "They observed that most of the variations were identified at an average depth of 100×.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Ajay et al.\n",
      "[15] calculated the genome coverage and discovery rates of variants in healthy samples using WGS data at 100× average mapped depth.\n",
      "The callable portion of the genome was 90% at a depth of 40×, and that of the protein-coding exome region was about 88% at a depth of 100×.\n",
      "However, these studies analyzed sequencing data derived from healthy individuals; the adequate depth required to discover clinically significant variations still needs to be addressed.\n",
      "In this study, we investigated for the first time the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of genomic variations for clinical use.\n",
      "Toward this, we performed exome sequencing in ten germ-line blood samples from breast cancer patients using the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high depth of ~200×.\n",

      "To investigate the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of clinically meaningful variants, we first sequenced the whole blood DNA samples from ten breast cancer patients using the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high sequencing depth of ~200× (Fig.1A).\n",
      "The platform covers 95% of the human exonic regions (http://www.gemomics.agilent.com).\n",
      "We then extracted data at depths of 20× to 200× by random selection and shuffling (Fig.1B).\n",

      "Diverse variations such as SNPs, and insertions and deletions (indels) were called by using the GATK [16].\n",
      "We also called function-related variations after the annotation of functional and regional information using various open databases and tools (Methods).\n",
      "Finally, we analyzed counts, positions, reading depths, and genomic coverage of the identified variations as a function of the sequencing depth using total or diagnostic gene sets (Fig.1D).\n",
      "We first checked the numbers of called SNPs in protein-coding (denoted as \"coding SNPs\") and total genomic regions (denoted as \"total SNPs\") of the platform in order to assess the effect of sequencing depth on the discovery of SNPs (Fig.2A).\n",
      "As expected, the numbers of the identified total SNPs increased at higher average sequencing depths.\n",
      "For example, the median number of total SNPs for the ten samples gradually increased from 33,765 at 20× to 114,707 at 200× (an increase of 80,942 for the total SNPs).\n",
      "However, the median number of SNPs in the coding regions increased more rapidly in the first half (an increase of 59,073 from 20× to 120×), and reached a plateau at an average sequencing depth of around 120×.\n",
      "The increase in the number of coding SNPs was significantly smaller after that (an increase of 827 from 120× to 200×).\n",
      "This also means that the number of non-coding SNPs detected, both intronic and intergenic, increased rapidly after a depth of 120× was achieved.\n",
      "This phenomenon was more or less consistent across the sequencing data, from the first sample to the last.\n",
      "This trend was also preserved in the indel variants (Supplementary Fig.1).\n",
      "Further, the number of indels in the total region of the platform (denoted as \"total indels\") increased steadily, but the increasing ratio of indels in the coding regions (\"coding indels\") leveled off after a depth of 120× was achieved.\n",
      "After functional annotation using the SnpEff database [20], we analyzed the numbers of functional SNPs (nonsense, missense, and silent) while increasing the sequencing depth.\n",
      "The results indicate that the median number of missense SNPs detected in the ten samples increased from 6,015 to 9,731 (Fig.2B).\n",
      "However, the rate of increase was sharp in the first half, slowing significantly after 120×.\n",
      "We observed a similar trend for the nonsense SNPs as well.\n",
      "In addition, this phenomenon was also observed for the deleterious SNPs using the SIFT [21] (Fig.2C).\n",
      "In summary, the number of deleterious SNPs detected, such as missense and nonsense, increased with the sequencing depth, but the ratio of this increase reduced significantly after 120×.\n",
      "Mutations in splice sites are associated with many diseases [252627].\n",
      "Therefore, we next analyzed the number of SNPs detected near splice sites with respect to the sequence depth (Fig.3).\n",
      "We found that the number of called SNPs increased with increasing depth.\n",
      "However, many of the SNPs were detected in intronic regions around the splice sites, about twice the number of those detected in exonic regions, when increasing the sequencing depth.\n",
      "The number of detected SNPs, though, was lowest at the splice sites.\n",
      "This might imply that the sequences of the exonic regions surrounding the splice sites are well conserved than those of the intronic regions.\n",
      "However, researchers who wish to detect susceptible SNPs in splice sites might have to sequence at depths of more than 120×.\n",
      "Similarly, all the variations reported in the dbSNP database were also more common in the intronic, rather than the exonic regions (Supplementary Fig.2).\n",
      "To summarize, the number of deleterious SNPs and indels detected in the coding regions (which are widely used in clinical diagnostics) was only weakly increased a depths more than 120×.\n",

      "We further observed that the distributions of the average mapped depths between all human genes in the platform and the diagnostic genes were similar (Supplementary Fig.3).\n",
      "Moreover, with increasing depths, as expected, the median average mean depth of the ten samples increased almost constantly from a depth of 13.3× to 125.1× (on average, an increase of 12.4× per depth) (bar charts in Fig.4).\n",
      "In contrast, the coverage curves for the coding regions of the diagnostic genes followed logarithmic trends, regardless of the thresholds of the minimum read depths (line charts in Fig.4).\n",

      "The results indicate that all variations associated with breast cancer were detected at 140× depth, regardless of the sample.\n",
      "In summary, with exome capture sequencing technique, the most significant clinical variations can be detected at an average depth of 120×.\n",
      "Finally, we measured the discovery rates of variants at different sequencing depths using Sanger sequencing (Fig.7).\n",
      "The results show that more than 90% variations were validated when 120×.\n",
      "Hence, we conclude that, using the exome capture sequencing technique, the most reliable variants are detected at an average depth of 120×.\n",
      "In this study, we determined the effects of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of function-related diverse variants of human genes and diagnostic genes, especially for clinical use.\n",
      "For this purpose, we investigated the exome deep-sequencing data for whole blood DNA samples obtained from ten breast cancer patients using an Illumina platform GAII(x) as a function of sequencing depth.\n",

      "The results were also consistent with a diagnostic gene set and were similar across samples.\n",
      "Considering the diverse costs and time related to generation, processing, and maintenance of sequencing data, this suggests that a feasible depth for clinically relevant exome sequencing is about 120×.\n",

      "DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing provide data that can be used for the genetic analysis of multiple quantitative traits such as gene expression levels, transcription factor binding profiles, and epigenetic signatures.\n",
      "In particular, chromatin opening is tightly coupled with gene transcription.\n",
      "To understand how these two processes are genetically regulated and associated with each other, we examined the changes of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in response to genetic variation by means of quantitative trait loci mapping.\n",
      "Regulatory patterns commonly observed in yeast and human across different technical platforms and experimental designs suggest a higher genetic complexity of transcription regulation in contrast to a more robust genetic architecture of chromatin regulation.\n",

      "From the human chromatin accessibility data [8], we selected chromatin sites at the promoter or enhancer (as defined by Ernst et al.[21]).\n",
      "Yeast and human QTL mapping was different in the genetics setting (linkage vs. association) and technical platforms (DNA microarray vs. RNA-seq and FAIRE-seq vs. DNase-seq) (Fig.1).\n",
      "We selected significant trans-associations based on the p-value of linear regression and then examined the distribution of linkages between regulatory loci (genetic markers) and quantitative traits (gene expression levels or chromatin accessibility).\n",

      "This trend was consistently found when varying p-values were used (Fig.4).\n",
      "Intriguingly, the number of targets for chromatin regulatory loci is more dispersed resulting in outliers with extremely many targets while the average number is lower as compared to the pattern of expression regulatory loci (grey vs. white in the upper panel of Fig.4).\n",
      "On the other hand, the number of associated regulatory loci was much greater for gene expression traits in terms of the outliers and average as well (grey vs. white in the lower panel of Fig.4).\n",

      "There are a few regulatory hotspots that are responsible for a large number of chromatin sites.\n",
      "Most regulatory loci, however, tend to influence fewer chromatin traits than gene expression traits.\n",
      "Different biological functions are expected between the promiscuous and specific chromatin regulators.\n",
      "On the other hand, gene expression seems to be more reactive to genetic variation when judged by the number of associated regulatory loci.\n",
      "This may imply that transcription processes receive more regulatory inputs than chromatin regulation, in which case chromatin accessibility may not be a good predictor of precise gene expression levels.\n",
      "There was a remarkable consistency of the data for two evolutionarily distant species across different technical platforms and experimental settings, thereby supporting the biological implications of the findings while ruling out the possibility of technical artifacts.\n",
      "Based on these findings, we propose that chromatin regulation mechanisms have evolved a stable genetic architecture while the transcription regulatory network maintains high genetic complexity and connectivity and is more susceptible to mutations.\n",
      "First, the lower number of associations per chromatin trait suggests that chromatin structure is more robust to genetic perturbation.\n",
      "On the contrary, gene expression traits have more associations, increasing the probability of targets being associated with mutations.\n",
      "Second, chromatin associations are biased to a handful of loci responsible for an extremely large number of chromatin sites.\n",
      "As long as these hotspot loci are protected from mutations, the perturbation of chromatin regulation architecture could be minimized.\n",
      "In contrast, the average number of associations is high for transcription regulatory loci, increasing the overall effect of single mutations.\n",
      "Given the higher probability of expression traits being associated with mutations and the greater influence of individual mutations on transcription, it is conceivable that phenotypic diversity is more likely to be created in response to genetic variation at the level of transcription processes downstream of chromatin regulation steps.\n",

      "DNA microarray techniques have been widely used in biological research by enabling comprehensive understanding of molecular and systematic mechanism [23].\n",
      "In addition, microarray experiments enable researchers to identify gene sets undergoing a response to a specific stimulus as well as to analyze dynamic response at the level of gene regulatory network [4].\n",
      "Especially, microarray experiments could be designed to study downstream effects of a specific stimulus or diverse stimuli on gene expression at the level of genomic scale, not a single genetic one [5].\n",
      "Microarray techniques could be a power tool to discover regulatory factors as most of co-expressed genes are co-regulated by the same regulatory factors [6].\n",
      "Moreover, because genes co-regulated by the same transcription factor (TF) commonly share binding sites for this TF [6], it would be worth to detect TF based on motif discovery method.\n",

      "In this case, expression values of target genes are not considered, and this regulatory network cannot explain how those regulators affect expression variation of target genes.\n",
      "We tried to explain expression variation of target genes with those of TFs identified by iRegulon.\n",
      "However, the expression variation of a TF did not resemble those of target genes.\n",
      "It suggests that expression variations of multiple TFs should be considered collectively to understand those of target genes.\n",
      "With the TFs predicted by iRegulon, we constructed a hierarchical regulatory network among them using Genomica, explaining the expression variation of the target genes.\n",
      "As shown Fig.4, a combination of multiple TFs instead of a single TF explained the expression variations of target genes.\n",
      "For example, MEF2A which is at the top of the regulatory TF network had the largest influence on the expression variations of the target genes, and YY1, the second highest ranking TF, did not influence as much as MEF2A.\n",

      "However, some biologists and ecologists have difficulty using these indices because they require advanced mathematical knowledge and computational techniques.\n",

      "VBioindex serves as an easy to use interface and visually represents the results in the form of a simple chart and in addition, VBioindex offers functions for long-term investigations of datasets using time-series analyses.\n",
      "The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines biodiversity as \"the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns\" [12].\n",

      "Thus, many researchers use quantitative measures of biodiversity in an attempt to sustain and restore ecosystems [5].\n",
      "Biodiversity is generally measured by statistical indices based on the emergence and/or existence of various organisms such as plants, animals, and microbes; these indices can provide quantitative criteria with increased confidence for biodiversity [67].\n",
      "Of the statistical indices, Shannon-Wiener index [8], species richness, and evenness [9] have been widely used as the gold standards, in spite of traditional methods.\n",
      "The Shannon-Wiener index is based on information theory and is measured using the concept of entropy, and it is applied to estimate the degree of species diversity in a region [10].\n",
      "Species richness and evenness measure the number of different species per sample and the relative abundance of the different species, respectively [11].\n",
      "For measuring biodiversity, there are a few non-commercial tools, such as the Vegan package in R [12], EstimateS [13], and the web-based Shannon Entropy Calculator (http:// www.changbioscience.com/genetics/shannon.html).\n",
      "Although they are highly useful, some of them are difficult and complicated for biologists to use, especially some programs involving R package.\n",

      "\n",
      "The karyotypes of most species of crocodilians were studied using conventional and molecular cytogenetics.\n",
      "These provided an important contribution of chromosomal rearrangements for the evolutionary processes of Crocodylia and Sauropsida (birds and reptiles).\n",
      "The karyotypic features of crocodilians contain small diploid chromosome numbers (30~42), with little interspecific variation of the chromosome arm number (fundamental number) among crocodiles (56~60).\n",
      "This suggested that centric fusion and/or fission events occurred in the lineage, leading to crocodilian evolution and diversity.\n",
      "The chromosome numbers of Alligator, Caiman, Melanosuchus, Paleosuchus, Gavialis, Tomistoma, Mecistops, and Osteolaemus were stable within each genus, whereas those of Crocodylus (crocodylians) varied within the taxa.\n",
      "This agreed with molecular phylogeny that suggested a highly recent radiation of Crocodylus species.\n",
      "Karyotype analysis also suggests the direction of molecular phylogenetic placement among Crocodylus species and their migration from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and The New World.\n",
      "Crocodylus species originated from an ancestor in the Indo-Pacific around 9~16 million years ago (MYA) in the mid-Miocene, with a rapid radiation and dispersion into Africa 8~12 MYA.\n",
      "This was followed by a trans-Atlantic dispersion to the New World between 4~8 MYA in the Pliocene.\n",
      "The chromosomes provided a better understanding of crocodilian evolution and diversity, which will be useful for further study of the genome evolution in Crocodylia.\n",
      "Crocodilians (Crocodylia) are extant large-sized reptiles found throughout the tropics in freshwater lakes, rivers, and oceans.\n",
      "Crocodilians diverged from birds, their closest living relatives as Archosauromorpha more than 240 million years ago (MYA).\n",
      "Ancestral crocodilian species first appeared in the fossil record around 80 MYA during the Late Cretaceous [1].\n",
      "Extant crocodilians contain 25 species, classified into two families: Alligatoridae (comprising genera: Alligator, Caiman, Paleosuchus, and Melanosuchus) and Crocodylidae (comprising genera: Gavialis, Tomistoma, Mecistops, Osteolaemus, and Crocodylus) [2].\n",
      "These crocodilians share both ancient and recent morphology as well as ecological characters [1].\n",
      "The understanding of the phylogenetic history and biogeography in this lineage has provided a fascinating study for evolutionary biologists.\n",
      "A phylogenetic approach for crocodilians was originally conducted based on fossil records.\n",
      "These suggested that the Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) was a basal crocodilian [1]; however, molecular datasets indicated that Alligator diverged from the remaining crocodilians around 50~70 MYA in the Tertiary, of which Crocodylus are the most recent group (Fig.1) [3456789101112131415161718192021222324].\n",
      "This suggested that Alligator was the most ancient crocodilian; however, relationships among living species of Crocodylus remain poorly resolved, since they radiated into various species around 9~13 MYA during the middle of the Miocene [16].\n",
      "These issues have received high priority in modern systematics by combining many datasets to determine the true groupings and divergences among them.\n",
      "One possibility is the level of different chromosome constitution, though crocodilians exhibit slow divergence of karyotype among living species.\n",
      "However, various karyotypic forms in the lineage are probably the source of reproductive isolation, which eventually radiated into species diversity.\n",
      "Remarkably, chromosomal investigation of 23 crocodilians revealed karyotypic features: small diploid chromosome numbers (30~42), the predominance of a few large chromosomes, and the absence of dot-shaped microchromosomes whose centromere positions are undetectable [1920].\n",
      "This contradicts with the karyotypes of birds (the sister group of Archosauromorpha), and the relative lineage of turtles, which contain a small number of macrochromosomes and many indistinguishable microchromosomes [2025].\n",
      "The increase of large bi-armed chromosomes and the presence of small chromosomes probably correlate with the reduction of medium acrocentric chromosomes and the absence of microchromosomes, respectively, in these lineages [2526].\n",
      "The chromosome arm number or fundamental number (NF, bi-armed chromosome: metacentric or submetacentric = 2; uni-armed chromosome: acrocentric or subtelocentric = 1) of all crocodilian karyotypes shows little interspecific variation (56~60), and no sex chromosome heteromorphism has been recognized in any species [192027].\n",
      "These characteristics of crocodilian karyotypes indicated that very few chromosomal rearrangements have occurred in Crocodylia, except for centric fusion and/or fission events.\n",
      "To delineate the role of chromosomal rearrangement, which also plays an evolutionary force in crocodilian diversity and evolution, the karyotype data and phylogeny were summarized as (1) variation of chromosome constitution within crocodilians compared to other sauropsids (birds and reptiles), (2) current phylogenetic history of crocodilians from molecular data and paleontological perspective, and (3) correlation of chromosomal rearrangements in each lineage and phylogeny in crocodilians.\n",
      "Sauropsids (birds and reptiles) number around 20,000 species, comprising large group diversity in birds (9,900 species) and squamate reptiles (9,700 species), but small diversity in turtles (340 species) and crocodilians (25 species) [2].\n",
      "It is possible that the species richness of birds and squamate reptiles correlates with the large karyotype variability.\n",
      "By contrast, turtles and crocodiles show low chromosome constitution variability, although the correlation between chromosome changing rate and species number is found in turtles, but not in crocodiles [20282930].\n",
      "This probably results from the role of sex chromosomes as all crocodilians exhibit temperature sex determination, but both genetic sex determination (homomorphic and heteromorphic sex chromosomes) and temperature sex determination are found in other sauropsids (except for tuatara), leading to high speciation rate and species diversification [31].\n",
      "The crocodilian karyotype contains few large and many small chromosomes, and there is an absence of dot-shaped microchromosomes [1920].\n",
      "On the contrary, the karyotypes of most squamate reptiles, tuatara, turtles, and birds contain macro- and microchromosomes [20].\n",
      "Many chromosomal rearrangements might, therefore, be the result of the appearance or disappearance of microchromosomes, which reduced whole-chromosome homology among sauropsid chromosomes.\n",
      "The draft genome assemblies of chicken (Gallus gallus), Anolis lizard (Anolis carolinensis), Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), Indian gharial (G. gangeticus), Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), and king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) provided new perspectives on the comparative genomics of Sauropsida, which in turn facilitated extensive comparisons between genomic structures at a molecular level [323334353637].\n",
      "Recent comparative gene mapping of several sauropsid species (Pelodiscus sinensis, Testudines; Crocodylus siamensis, Crocodilia; Gekko hokouenesis, Lacerta agilis, Elaphe quadrivirgata, Varanus salvator macromaculatus, Leiolepis reevesii rubritaeniata, Pogona vitticeps, and A. carolinensis, Squamata) with those of chicken revealed the extensive homology between avian and reptilian chromosomes, and suggested that the common ancestor of amniotes may have had many microchromosomes, whose linkages have been conserved among chickens and reptiles [252633, 38394041424344].\n",
      "Comparison of the linkage homology between Archosauromorph and turtle chromosomes revealed that the macro- and microchromosomes of turtles are true counterparts of those of chicken [2526].\n",
      "However, the comparative cytogenetic map of the Siamese crocodile (C. siamensis), i.e., the first cytogenetic map in the crocodilian lineage, revealed that genetic linkages of large chromosomes were also conserved in blocks on chromosome arms that corresponded to chicken macrochromosomal arms and/or entire macrochromosomes.\n",
      "The five largest bi-armed chromosomes of crocodile are derived by combinations of chromosome arms that differ from the chicken karyotype, while chicken microchromosomal genes are all localized to small chromosomes of the crocodile.\n",
      "This suggested that the Siamese crocodile karyotype resulted from two events that occurred in the crocodilian lineage: (1) centric fissions of bi-armed macrochromosomes in the ancestral Archosauromorph-turtle karyotype, followed by centric fusions between acrocentric macrochromosomes (new combination), leading to large chromosomes in crocodilians, and (2) repeated fusions of microchromosomes, which resulted in their disappearance and the appearance of a large number of small chromosomes [26].\n",
      "Notably, chromosome size-dependent genomic compartmentalization is often found in birds and turtles but not in squamate reptiles, such as microchromosome-specific centromere repetitive sequences [4546474849505152].\n",
      "This implied that the homogenization of centromeric repetitive sequences between macro- and microchromosomes did not predominantly occur in birds and turtles.\n",
      "However, no chromosome sized-specific centromeric repetitive sequences are found in crocodiles [21].\n",
      "This suggested that chromosomal size-dependent genomic compartmentalization which is supposedly unique to Archosauromorph and turtles was probably lost with the disappearance of microchromosomes, followed by the homogenization of centromeric repetitive sequences among chromosomes in the crocodilian lineage after their divergence from birds around 240 MYA.\n",
      "Diploid chromosome numbers in crocodilians range from 30 to 42; most are 32 (Fig.1) [1920].\n",
      "Most karyotypes in crocodilians contain 4~5 large bi-armed chromosomes, 20~22 small bi-armed chromosomes, and 4~8 uni-armed chromosomes.\n",
      "However, genome rearrangements among members in the order rarely occurred, giving all crocodilians a fundamental number of 56~60, which suggested that the ancestral crocodilian karyotype was highly conserved [192021222326].\n",
      "The chromosome number in Alligatoridae (Alligator 2n = 32, and Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus 2n = 42) is more varied than in Crocodylidae (Gavialis and Tomistoma 2n = 32, Mecistops 2n = 30, Osteolaemus 2n = 38, Crocodylus 2n = 30~34).\n",
      "Karyotypes of Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus show a large number of chromosome arms (NF = 60) [1920], suggesting that multiple centric fissions occurred after they diverged from Alligator.\n",
      "However, the largest chromosome variation is found in Crocodylus.\n",
      "The diploid chromosome number of 4 from 12 species (C. porosus, C. siamensis, Crocodylus palustris, and Crocodylus rhombifer) differs from 32, despite having the same fundamental number (58) (Fig.1).\n",
      "This suggests that centric fusion/fission played a crucial role in the process of chromosomal rearrangements, leading to the formation of ordinal radiation in the lineage of crocodilians.\n",
      "Crocodilian systematics has been discussed at higher-level relationships based on morphological, paleobiogeography, and molecular data [1, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,53,54,55].\n",
      "However, no study has completely explained crocodilian relationships with their distribution and ecology.\n",
      "Most molecular crocodilian phylogeny contains 23 species (Fig.1).\n",
      "The use of complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci (nuclear and mt genes) obviously provided the solution for at least three major conflicts of crocodilian clustering: (1) phylogenetic position of G. gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii; (2) relationship of Mecistops cataphractus and Crocodylus; and (3) position of C. siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris.\n",
      "Firstly, the position of G. gangeticus and T. schlegelii was controversial, since G. gangeticus was considered to be Gavialidae at the basal position of Crocodylia based on morphological evidence [153].\n",
      "The molecular phylogenetic study of complete mt genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci clearly showed that G. gangeticus was a sister-taxon with T. schlegelii, and formed the sister group with the traditional Crocodylidae (Fig.1) [8910111213141617].\n",
      "This agreed with molecular sequence-based analyses of the CR1 retrotransposon which suggested that Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) were sisters to all other crocodilians, and supported the G. gangeticus-T. schlegelii clade [56].\n",
      "Therefore, only the two families (Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae) are now recognized to be within Crocodylia.\n",
      "The most basal species within Crocodylus and relative species (Osteolaemus tetraspis) is the African sharp-nosed crocodile, M. cataphractus (formerly called Crocodylus cataphractus) [57].\n",
      "Fossil evidence related to M. cataphractus appeared in the Miocene and Pliocene in Africa [585960], and implied that M. cataphractus was grouped within Crocodylus.\n",
      "However, molecular datasets suggested two relative species of two African crocodiles, M. cataphractus and O. tetraspis, being a sister group to the true crocodiles (Crocodylus) [4891011121314151617].\n",
      "The last conflict issue concerned the position of C. siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris.\n",
      "In terms of molecular data, a complete mt genome of C. siamensis (DQ353946) showed it as a sister to C. porosus [24], whereas another mt genome sequence of C. siamensis (EF581859) related it to C. palustris [17].\n",
      "Nonetheless, a molecular study based on the mixture of several molecular loci found in many C. siamensis individuals clearly showed that C. siamensis was sister to C. palustris and that C. porosus was sister to both species [16].\n",
      "This agreed with karyological data that showed 2n = 30 for C. siamensis and C. palustris, and 2n = 34 for C. porosus (Fig.1) [1920212226].\n",
      "The Siamese crocodile sample sequenced by Ji et al.\n",
      "[24] was probably a hybrid between C. siamensis × C. porosus, frequently found in captivity in the crocodile industry [61].\n",
      "The Siamese crocodile sample sequenced by Srikulnath et al.\n",
      "[17] was confirmed by karyotyping, and showed a chromosome number 2n = 30, a true C. siamensis.\n",
      "However, the relationship within Crocodylus remained unclear because of the position of Indo-Pacific crocodilians (Fig.1).\n",
      "A molecular study based on complete mt genome sequences strongly indicated two major groups: (1) The Indo-Pacific species and (2) The African-New World (America) species.\n",
      "A molecular study with the mixture of several molecular loci comprising nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested that the African-New World species grouped with C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis and was a sister clade with the group of Crocodylus mindorensis, Crocodylus novaeguineae, and Crocodylus johnstoni (Fig.1) [16].\n",
      "Multiple lines of evidence from biogeography and karyotypes have provided promising data to extensively discuss their evolutionary history.\n",
      "According to the chromosome constitution of crocodilians, it would appear that chromosome changes evolved in parallel with the crocodilian relationship.\n",
      "Alligatoridae, which appeared in the early Tertiary, are considered to be the most primitive group in extant crocodilians [1].\n",
      "There are two major crocodilians in Alligatoridae (Alligator and Caiman + Melanosuchus + Paleosuchus) generally found in the New World (America).\n",
      "This agreed with karyological data, which showed different karyotypic features in both chromosome number and fundamental number.\n",
      "Two Alligator species (A. mississippiensis and A. sinensis) still have the same karyotype form (2n = 32), but the karyotype of Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus, a sister clade of Alligator contains a higher chromosome number (2n = 42): a lower number of bi-armed chromosomes and a higher number of uni-armed chromosomes.\n",
      "This suggests that multiple centric fission occurred at the split of Alligator and Caiman + Melanosuchus + Paleosuchus, around 50~70 MYA before the middle of the Eocene (Fig.1).\n",
      "This is more likely than an alternative explanation of the presence of centric fusion, because the karyotype of most crocodilians also exhibits 2n = 32.\n",
      "Interestingly, the total chromosome numbers of Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus are the same, but Paleosuchus contains a lower number of bi-armed and a higher number of uni-armed chromosomes, resulting in different fundamental numbers (Fig.1).\n",
      "This suggests that Caiman + Melanosuchus and Paleosuchus evolved independently through at least one pericentric inversion or centromere positioning event, leading to ordinal radiation in two different lineages.\n",
      "Two Alligator species (A. mississippiensis and A. sinensis), which exhibit the same karyotype form of 2n = 32, spread over more than one biogeography.\n",
      "A. mississippiensis is restricted to the Southeastern United States, whereas A. sinensis is restricted to China.\n",
      "Both species shared a common ancestor around 20~60 MYA (Fig.1) [116].\n",
      "This suggested the possibility of a geographic isolation process that played an important role in their evolutionary history.\n",
      "An overland route (presumably through Beringia) is the shortest distance from North America to Asia.\n",
      "Alligator probably moved to Asia during the warmer climate of the early Tertiary [16], based on the limitation of temperature and salt water tolerance [626364].\n",
      "On the contrary, A. sinensis is the most cold-adapted of all living crocodilians, surviving the winter in burrows [65].\n",
      "It might have moved into China during dramatic temperature changes.\n",
      "However, there was no evidence to support this idea until alligator fossils were found in Alaska [1].\n",
      "The ancestral karyotype of crocodile is still retained in Crocodylidae.\n",
      "The karyotype of G. gangaticus (2n = 32) which resided in South-Asia, is also highly similar to that of Alligator [1920].\n",
      "However, the karyotype of T. schlegelii (2n = 32), distributed around South-East Asia, contains lower numbers of bi-armed chromosomes and higher numbers of uni-armed chromosomes, and the fundamental numbers of these two species are different.\n",
      "This suggests the presence of pericentric inversion or centromere positioning, which probably occurred in T. schlegelii after it diverged from G. gangaticus around 15~35 MYA in the late Tertiary.\n",
      "In Crocodylus and relative species (M. cataphractus and O. tetraspis) lineage, the karyotype of M. cataphractus showed a lower total chromosome number with higher bi-armed chromosomes than those of T. schlegelii, despite having the same fundamental number (58), suggesting that the increase of bi-armed chromosomes is the result of centric fusion among the ancestral types of acrocentric chromosomes (Fig.1).\n",
      "By contrast, the karyotype of O. tetraspis showed a higher total chromosome number with higher uni-armed chromosomes, but lower bi-armed chromosomes than those of G. gangaticus, T. schlegelii, and M. cataphractus [1920].\n",
      "This suggests that at least multiple centric fissions occurred after O. tetraspis diverged from G. gangaticus, T. schlegelii, and M. cataphractus around 14~37 MYA.\n",
      "Karyotypes resembling (2n = 32) T. schlegelii are also found in Crocodylus.\n",
      "This suggests that both T. schlegelii and Crocodylus share the same karyotypic feature which is derived from G. gangaticus and Alligator as a common ancestor of Crocodylia.\n",
      "By contrast, Crocodylus, only one genus in crocodilians, shows variation of chromosome number and chromosome morphology, in spite of the same chromosome number.\n",
      "This suggests that karyotype evolution occurred in Crocodylus, and subsequently radiated karyotypic forms in different species, during the period of crocodilian extinction around 9~16 MYA in the middle of the Miocene (Fig.1) [16].\n",
      "It is likely that after climate optimum in mid-Miocene, speciation process of Crocodylus was conducted along with global cooling and glaciation until the end of Pliocene, whereas other crocodilians underwent massive extinction [64].\n",
      "The role of chromosome changes with species diversity is also found in other species during the same period, such as New World rodent (Calomys) [66] or African rodent (Tatera) [67].\n",
      "Interestingly, the chromosome structure of Crocodylus species is likely conserved within the genus.\n",
      "This agreed with the presence of hybridization in captivity, often found in Crocodylus species.\n",
      "It would appear that all species from the genus have the potential to hybridize and produce fertile offspring.\n",
      "Examples of such events have been reported in both sympatric [6869] and allopatric species [61].\n",
      "C. siamensis with chromosome number 2n = 30 has also hybridized with C. porosus with chromosome number 2n = 34.\n",
      "Chavananikul et al.\n",
      "[70] found that interspecific breeding of C. siamensis and C. porosus produced F1 hybrids (2n = 32) and F2 offspring with 2n = 32.\n",
      "This suggested hybrid viability, despite different chromosome numbers in the parent generation.\n",
      "This probably results from genome features that are still similar and not diverse in a short period of time in Crocodylus.\n",
      "Thus, the study of hybrid viability, homologous recombination, and meiotic segregation mechanisms may be critical to understand their genome evolution.\n",
      "However, the relative stability of Crocodylus genomes contributes to the lack of postzygotic reproductive isolation mechanisms, which is a fascinating aspect of crocodilian evolutionary biology, and rejects the traditional biological species concept.\n",
      "Other evidence of high conservation in chromosome structure is satellite DNA (stDNA) at the centromeric region on crocodilian chromosomes.\n",
      "Two stDNAs (CSI-HindIII-S and CSI-HindIII-M) isolated from C. siamensis and localized to centromeric regions of all chromosomes, except for chromosome 2, were highly conserved throughout several crocodilian species (Crocodylus niloticus, T. schlegelii, G. gangeticus, A. mississippiensis, A. sinensis, Caiman crocodilus, and Caiman latirostris) [21].\n",
      "This suggested that CSI-HindIII sequences were contained in the karyotype of a common ancestor of Crocodylia.\n",
      "However, the evolutionary history of Crocodylus species recently diversified during a period of crocodilian extinction.\n",
      "This tallied with the evidence of a centromeric stDNA (CSI-DraI), which was also isolated from C. siamensis and localized to chromosome 2, and four pairs of small-sized chromosomes, were recognized in the genus Crocodylus but not in other crocodilians (Lapbenjakul et al.unpublished data) [21].\n",
      "This suggested that CSI-DraI differentiated as a very rapidly evolving molecule in the Crocodylus lineage when crocodilian extinction began, and the molecular structure of centromeric regions of Crocodylus evolved independently from other crocodilians.\n",
      "Within the Crocodylus lineage, molecular sequence analyses suggested highly recent radiation in this crocodilian group (Fig.1) [16].\n",
      "The relationship of A + T content (%) and AT-skew of the mtDNA genome also agreed with this indication as a high correlation between A + T content and AT-skew in many Crocodylus species but low correlation in other crocodilians (Fig.2), suggesting that the bias of base substitution that occurred in the Crocodylus lineage did not have time to eminently alter the base composition of mtDNA genome as in other crocodilian divergences [17].\n",
      "Traditionally, Crocodylus was considered to have originated in Africa during the Cretaceous [71], and their current distribution has resulted from continental drift [72].\n",
      "However, recent molecular data and fossil records in Asia suggested that the Indo-Pacific was the place of origin of Crocodylus species [16].\n",
      "They then migrated to the land based on two hypotheses: (1) dispersion from Indo-Pacific to the New World, followed by dispersion to Africa; and (2) dispersion from the Indo-Pacific into Africa, followed by dispersion to the New World.\n",
      "This hypothesis suggested the trans-Pacific dispersion of Crocodylus from the Indo-Pacific to the New World around 8~12 MYA, followed by moving to Africa from the New World around 4~8 MYA.\n",
      "This hypothesis was supported by at least three pieces of evidence: the presence of fossil crocodilian records within Asia and the New World [173], the distribution of the saltwater crocodile C. porosus, and the extinct Crocodylus lineage in the Pacific islands.\n",
      "Molecular phylogenetic placement by Oaks [16] showed the sister group of C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis clade and New World Crocodylus species.\n",
      "However, it is hard to explain how C. porosus (2n = 34) and/or C. palustris and C. siamensis (2n = 30) migrated and evolved into New World species (2n = 32), whose karyotype retains an ancestral form.\n",
      "It is likely that the C. porosus karyotype resulted from the proto-Crocodylus karyotype by centric fission, and the New World species karyotypes experienced centric fusion reversibly again from C. porosus.\n",
      "The dispersion of Crocodylus from the Indo-Pacific into Africa occurred 8~12 MYA, followed by trans-Atlantic dispersion to the New World 4~8 MYA.\n",
      "The crocodilian fossil record also showed that Crocodylus species were present in Southern Europe and Northern Africa during the late Miocene with warmer and wetter climate across this region [747576].\n",
      "This might have allowed the Crocodylus species to move from Asia into Africa without requiring long-distance marine dispersion.\n",
      "It is likely that the species group comprising C. mindorensis, C. novaeguineae, and C. johnstoni, positioned to the basal node of the phylogenetic tree as suggested by Oaks [16] might be the origin of the Indo-Pacific species.\n",
      "This agreed with karyological data of Crocodylus, which showed a diploid chromosome of C. mindorensis, C. novaeguineae, C. johnstoni (Indo-Pacific species) C. niloticus (African species), Crocodylus moreletii, Crocodylus acutus, and Crocodylus intermedius (New World species) to be 32.\n",
      "Crocodylus maintained the broad African and Indo-Pacific distribution, and then split between the African + New World species clade and the remaining Indo-Pacific species around 4~8 MYA.\n",
      "The latter hypothesis is more likely, based on the most parsimonious explanation with karyological data.\n",
      "This also agreed with the phylogenetic relationship of some Nile crocodiles (C. niloticus), complete mt genome sequences placed with those of New World species, and the exclusion of Nile crocodiles from other populations [15].\n",
      "The two earliest fossils of C. niloticus and New World species appear during the Pliocene [73], and C. niloticus has lingual salt-excreting glands.\n",
      "Moreover, some populations of C. niloticus occupy estuarine habitats [63].\n",
      "This suggested that an African crocodilian crossed the Atlantic recently, when this oceanic barrier was hundreds of miles wide [1577].\n",
      "The presence of trans-Atlantic dispersion is also found in other vertebrates [78].\n",
      "The molecular placement of C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis is expected to position as the sister to African + New World species (Fig.1).\n",
      "The ancestral karyotype feature is still retained in African and New World crocodiles.\n",
      "Comparison of the data of chromosome painting in C. niloticus and chromosome maps with functional genes in C. siamensis, revealed that five large chromosomes of C. siamensis correspond to six large chromosomes of C. niloticus [2326].\n",
      "C. siamensis chromosome 3 (CSI3) is metacentric, and C. niloticus chromosome 5 (CNI5) and CNI6 are acrocentrics.\n",
      "CSI3p corresponds to CNI6, and CSI3q to CNI5.\n",
      "This suggests that bi-armed chromosomes CSI3 are the results of centric fusion among the ancestral types of acrocentric chromosomes (Fig.3).\n",
      "A centric fusion event is more likely because CNI5 and CNI6 are considered the prototypes in the lineages of Crocodylus, based on the evidence of karyotype and chromosome constitution with other crocodilians [1920].\n",
      "The karyotype of C. palustris and C. siamensis (2n = 30) probably resulted from one centric fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes from ancestral Crocodylus species from the Indo-Pacific species, leading to the reduction of uni-armed chromosomes in both two species.\n",
      "By contrast, karyotype of C. porosus (2n = 34) might result from one centric fission of large bi-armed chromosomes from ancestral Crocodylus species, leading to the increase of acrocentric chromosomes.\n",
      "Simultaneously, the molecular placement of New World species is also controversial, considering complete mt genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci, in which C. rhombifer and C. moreletii are positioned at a basal or recent clade (Fig.1).\n",
      "The karyotype data of C. niloticus and New World species (C. acutus and C. intermedius) suggest that the karyotype of C. moreletii and C. rhombifer is probably located at the recent clade of New World species.\n",
      "The karyotype of C. moreletii contains a lower number of bi-armed chromosomes and a higher number of uni-armed chromosomes, compared to C. acutus and C. intermedius, making the fundamental numbers of these three species different.\n",
      "This suggests that the presence of pericentric inversion or centromere positioning has probably occurred in the ancestral karyotype of C. moreletii after divergence from C. acutus and C. intermedius around 3~7 MYA during the Pliocene.\n",
      "By contrast, the karyotype of C. rhombifer contains 2n = 30, and centric fusion might have occurred in the ancestral karyotype, leading to the reduction of acrocentric chromosomes in C. rhombifer.\n",
      "The role of chromosomal rearrangement led us to understand the evolutionary history of crocodilians to sauropsids and within the crocodilian lineage.\n",
      "It is likely that centric fusion/fission is a key evolutionary force of crocodilian diversity.\n",

      "Title: Introns: The Functional Benefits of Introns in Genomes\n",
      "\n",
      "The intron has been a big biological mystery since it was first discovered in several aspects.\n",
      "First, all of the completely sequenced eukaryotes harbor introns in the genomic structure, whereas no prokaryotes identified so far carry introns.\n",
      "Second, the amount of total introns varies in different species.\n",
      "Third, the length and number of introns vary in different genes, even within the same species genome.\n",
      "Fourth, all introns are copied into RNAs by transcription and DNAs by replication processes, but intron sequences do not participate in protein-coding sequences.\n",
      "The existence of introns in the genome should be a burden to some cells, because cells have to consume a great deal of energy to copy and excise them exactly at the correct positions with the help of complicated spliceosomal machineries.\n",
      "The existence throughout the long evolutionary history is explained, only if selective advantages of carrying introns are assumed to be given to cells to overcome the negative effect of introns.\n",
      "In that regard, we summarize previous research about the functional roles or benefits of introns.\n",
      "Additionally, several other studies strongly suggesting that introns should not be junk will be introduced.\n",
      "All eukaryotic genomes carry introns as parts of some gene structures and the introns are to be eliminated by a complex molecular machinery called the spliceosome comprising five snRNAs and more than 150 proteins [12].\n",
      "Although the debate on the origin of introns, i.e., the intron-early versus intron-late hypothesis, has still not been completed, it is obvious that most spliceosomal introns have been gained after prokaryote-eukaryote divergence [345], and there has been no spliceosomal introns found in prokaryotic lineages so far.\n",
      "The intron has still been propagating in some eukaryotic lineages [6], whereas other lineages have experienced extensive losses of introns during evolutionary life history [2].\n",
      "Primates have a higher density of intronic sequences than primitive eukaryotes that diverged earlier in eukaryotic life history, such as yeast, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans.\n",
      "Intron sequences constitute approximately 25% of the human genome, which is 4~5 times the size of exons [7].\n",
      "It has been noticed that the number of genes varies little between these eukaryotic species ranging less than 2-fold from 14,000 genes to 25,000 genes, whereas the size of introns greatly varies up to several fold, implicating that introns might have roles in determining species-specific characteristics and complexities [8].\n",
      "Introns certainly impose a huge energetic burden to the cell, considering that the density of introns (i.e., the genic regions consuming large amounts of energy for nothing in terms of protein synthesis) is greater than that of exons in genomes.\n",
      "The reasons that introns propagated in some eukaryotic genomes regardless of this energetic disadvantage have been issues yet to be explained.\n",
      "According to Lynch [9], introns are just selfish DNAs that invade protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes, and the deleterious introns can be sustained due to severe population bottlenecks.\n",
      "Many studies have discussed selective advantages that introns bring to the cell in eukaryotes, contributing to overcoming the energetic disadvantage [21011121314151617181920].\n",
      "However, the results derived from different studies are still controversial so far [132122232425].\n",
      "Recent multi-omics studies using a large-scale genome, transcriptome, and epigenome data produced by massively parallel sequencing techniques or next generation sequencing techniques provide an opportunity for us to investigate new territories in genomes and lead to novel functional insights into noncoding DNAs, intergenic regions, and introns.\n",
      "In the present review, we first introduce some studies showing what molecular characteristics of introns cannot be explained by a simple random mutational process that real junk DNAs may have undergone.\n",
      "Subsequently, we summarize the functional characteristics of introns that have been studied providing clues about the adaptive significance of introns in genomes.\n",
      "We divide the functional roles of introns into two different categories, i.e., direct roles and indirect roles in Table 1 [15262728293031323334353637383940414243444546], and demonstrate the details in the Results section.\n",
      "It is problematic, though, that the 'function' of genes in molecular biology generally has been limited in the concept of 'protein function'.\n",
      "As recently intensively debated, 'biological function' should be extended to expression regulation by cis-acting elements located at the outside regions of protein-coding parts in genes [47], and that is what we mean in discussing intron function.\n",

      "\n",
      "Title: Regulation of alternative splicing\n",
      "\n",
      "Introns are crucial because the protein repertoire or variety is greatly enhanced by alternative splicing in which introns take partly important roles.\n",
      "Alternative splicing is a controlled molecular mechanism producing multiple variant proteins from a single gene in a eukaryotic cell.\n",
      "One of the remarkable examples of the increasing protein repertoire by alternative splicing is the Drosophila Dscam gene, of which over 38000 isoforms can potentially be produced by alternative splicing.\n",
      "Pan et al.\n",
      "[27] have provided experimental evidence suggesting that approximately 95% of multiexon genes in the human genome may undergo alternative splicing.\n",
      "Furthermore, very short introns are selected against because a minimal length of intron is required for the splicing reaction [28].\n",
      "It has been noticed that the length of conservations in flanking introns of conserved alternative exons, i.e., exons that are alternative in several species, is greater than the length of conservations in flanking introns of conserved constitutive exons, i.e., exons that are constitutive in several species [26], suggesting that introns carry cis-acting elements that regulate alternative splicing.\n",
      "In fact, short cis-acting motifs that are necessary for binding splicing factors have been recognized and named intronic splicing silencers and intronic splicing enhancers.\n",
      "Title: Positive regulation of gene expression\n",
      "\n",
      "The expression enhancing effect of introns was first recognized in the experiment using simian virus 40 constructs with or without introns, showing that their protein products were significantly diminished without their introns [15].\n",
      "Subsequently, Buchman and Berg [48] showed that, in a certain condition, constructs with introns were expressed up to 400 times higher than constructs without introns, suggesting that introns can strongly enhance gene expression.\n",
      "In fact, some introns are designed to be included to construct expression vectors for guaranteeing a higher level of expression [49].\n",
      "A large-scale analysis performed in yeast also confirmed that genes with introns tend to have a higher level of gene expression compared to genes without introns [50].\n",
      "A similar observation was made in mammals, as well [51].\n",
      "Classically, enhancers mediate either direction of expression, up- and down-regulation of genes, and involve both spatial and temporal control of gene expression in a specific cell independent of genomic location [52].\n",
      "On the contrary, intron-mediated enhancers (IMEs) mainly identified in plant generally act in the expression enhancement of genes and are primarily located in the first ordinary intron position within a gene.\n",
      "In fact, in experiments performed in Arabidopsis, rice, and even mammals, the expression level of a gene with IMEs was increased up to 100-fold [29].\n",
      "Genomic location and distance from transcription start site can influence the IME activity unlike the mode of expression regulation performed by the classical enhancers [53].\n",
      "Transcription initiation and termination processes are cellular processes that involve introns, as well, which need some sequence elements in introns to be correctly completed.\n",
      "For instance, some studies showed that specific sequence elements in introns, such as enhancers and silencers, regulate transcription initiation through modulating the function of the promoters of genes [3054].\n",
      "Title: Regulation of nonsense-mediated decay\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) was originally known as a surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes that selectively removes mRNAs containing erroneously generated premature termination codons (PTCs).\n",
      "However, several recent studies have suggested that NMD may be another normal mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation [343555].\n",
      "Consistently, a recent study has shown that the levels of the expressions of genes important for plant development are regulated by NMD [36].\n",
      "The question is how NMD recognizes the PTC-containing transcripts, i.e., what the molecular characteristics of the NMD target transcripts are.\n",
      "Generally, NMD recognizes the transcript on which an exon-exon junction complex (EJC) resides more than 50~55 base-pairs downstream of an authentic termination codon as the premature transcripts, i.e., its target mRNAs, implicating that introns somehow play a role in recognizing the premature mRNA targets.\n",
      "Kalyna et al.\n",
      "[36] have shown that introns located in 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) play important roles in controlling NMD-sensitivity of transcripts.\n",
      "Title: Introns may be associated with mRNA transport or chromatin assembly\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been reported that spliced transcripts are exported faster from the nucleus to cytoplasm than their unspliced counterparts [5657] indicating the association between splicing machineries and nuclear export, although there are some contradictory studies [5859].\n",
      "In fact, nuclear transport to the cytoplasm of transcripts containing introns in their 5' UTRs was known to be regulated by the transcription export complex and the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, whereas the transport of transcripts lacking introns in their 5' UTRs was regulated by signal sequences located in the open reading frames (ORFs) of those genes [60].\n",
      "A recent experiment using fluorescence in situ hybridization has investigated how intron-bearing and intronless constructs are distributed differently across the nucleus and cytoplasm and showed that intron-bearing transcripts are preferentially located in the cytoplasm [31].\n",
      "There are some studies suggesting that introns may have a role in chromatin assembly as well.\n",
      "Recent genome-wide mapping analyses of nucleosome positions have shown that nucleosomes are relatively depleted in intron regions compared to exonic regions [3233].\n",
      "Schwartz et al.\n",
      "[32] have suggested that sequence elements of intron ends may be responsible for nucleosome depletion in introns by pushing the nucleosomes away toward exons.\n",
      "Title: Indirect roles of introns\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Different ordinal position of introns within the gene has a different functional role\n",
      "\n",
      "The first intron among all introns within a gene has particularly been a research focus.\n",
      "The first intron is the longest among all other downstream introns within a gene in most species including plants and animals [38].\n",
      "Additionally, certain transcription factor binding motifs are enriched in first introns [61].\n",
      "Different parts of genes have different average sizes of introns, e.g., the size of introns in the 5' UTRs are twice as large as introns in coding regions [62].\n",
      "In Drosophila, long introns evolve more slowly than shorter ones and first introns are the longest compared to other introns [3763].\n",
      "In Tetrahymena, the introns located closer to the 5' end of genes are more conserved than downstream introns.\n",
      "Our team also proved in a previous study that first introns are the longest and the most conserved [39] compared to other downstream introns.\n",
      "Furthermore, we showed that active histone marks, such as H3K4me1, and H3K4me3, are significantly enriched in the first introns, and the size of the first intron of a gene becomes bigger as the number of exons that gene carries increases.\n",
      "Additionally, we showed in the same paper that the proportions of regulatory histone marks are positively associated with the levels of gene expressions in 12 normal human tissues including kidney, heart, liver, and ovary [39].\n",
      "Additionally, a replacement of the second intron with other introns in the beta-globin gene in human led to a reduction of the efficiency of 3'-end formation [64].\n",
      "Introns, particularly first introns, have important roles in the correct cytoplasmic localization of some mRNAs, including the Drosophila oskar gene and mRNA export [6065] as well as in transcriptional and translational regulation [616667].\n",
      "Taken together, first introns among all introns within genes have special functional characteristics, indicating that the existence of introns within genes is highly unlikely to be the product of a random process.\n",
      "Title: Introns length matters in the efficiency of natural selection\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Comeron et al.\n",
      "[41], long introns are favored because they increase the efficiency of natural selection by releasing The Hill-Robertson (HR) interference.\n",
      "The HR interference was basically described as genetic linkage between two sites under selection in finite populations, leading to decreasing effectiveness of natural selection [41].\n",
      "The HR interference model predicts that selection efficiency should be different between genes that differ in exon-intron structures, so that genes with longer introns should be under weaker HR interference by increasing recombination between two sites in two neighboring exons.\n",
      "In other words, introns may have a role in relaxing intragenic HR interference between sites under the influence of natural selection in finite populations.\n",
      "Recombination gives the opportunity for two independently occurring favorable alleles at linked loci to be located together and thus enhances the efficiency of natural selection [40], which can be one of the plausible scenarios of how introns have been sustained through the evolutionary history of genes.\n",
      "Title: Introns can provide a source of new genes\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, Carvunis et al.\n",
      "[42] suggested a very interesting hypothesis about how novel genes arise from non-functional translated ORFs, named proto-genes, by showing that hundreds of short ORFs of proto-genes located in non-genic sequences were actually translated and might provide adaptive potential to cells in different physiological environments in Ascomycota phylogeny, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n",
      "According to their model, the short ORFs can evolve into real functional genes through a kind of continuous evolutionary process.\n",
      "In that sense, long non-coding intron regions in higher eukaryotes can be a good reservoir of short and non-functional ORFs.\n",
      "Title: Trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are enriched in introns\n",
      "\n",
      "Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a popular approach to identify trait associated genetic variants so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n",
      "GWASs compare the allele frequencies of case groups (i.e., disease groups) and control groups (i.e., normal groups) of study participants to identify the SNPs that are significantly more enriched in case groups than control groups.\n",
      "If an allele is significantly more frequent in case groups, the allele is said to be a disease-associated allele, or a trait-associated SNP (TAS).\n",
      "In theory, TASs are considered to reside near sites of actual disease-causing mutations in genomes.\n",
      "Interestingly, most of the TASs detected by GWASs have been mapped to intron regions rather than exonic or nonsysnonymous sites (Fig.1A) [4368].\n",
      "The statistical significance of this finding was proven by a comparison of the proportion of intronic SNPs mapped by all SNPs obtained from 'v dbSNP 142' after subtracting the TASs (i.e., all SNPs minus TASs) and the proportion of intronic TASs (p<0.01) (Fig.1B).\n",
      "Investigation of the functional implication of these intron-TASs will thus be an important research subject in the future.\n",
      "Title: Introns harbor several kinds of noncoding functional RNA genes\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies based on massively parallel sequencing techniques have contributed to identifying various types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in genomes including miRNAs, siRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and they are known to be preferentially located in the intron regions within genes [46].\n",
      "For instance, about half of the miRNAs in the human genome are located in introns, and they are usually co-expressed with their host genes regulated by the promoters of host genes [44].\n",
      "Similar to miRNAs, some snoRNAs reside in introns, and they are also regulated by host transcriptional and splicing machineries [45].\n",
      "Other ncRNAs, including lncRNAs and siRNAs, are also found in intron regions, though the proportion of lncRNAs and siRNAs in introns is lower than that of miRNAs and snoRNAs in introns [246].\n",
      "Introns are classically degraded after the completion of splicing; however, these ncRNA genes embedded in intron regions are produced upon intron removal [246].\n",
      "Furthermore, they can survive even longer than the intronic host genes [2].\n",
      "Considering that the ncRNAs located in introns are co-expressed and co-regulated with their host genes by the promoters and splicing machineries of host genes, they are considered to be involved in auto-regulation of the expression of host genes [46].\n",
      "The existence of introns in genome is a real mystery, given the expensive energy cost for a cell to pay for copying the entire length of several introns in a gene and excising them at the exact position, controlled by big RNA and protein complexes after transcription.\n",
      "Nevertheless, most completely genomes of eukaryotic cells so far carry introns in their genomes [6970], and some studies even showed that introns had been propagated during eukaryotic lineage evolution [39717273].\n",
      "The origin of spliceosomal introns in eukaryotic lineage has been attempted to be explained by the massive invasion of group II self-splicing introns from bacteria to eukaryotes [35].\n",
      "It is very hard to understand how and why introns propagate in eukaryotic lineages and what the beneficial effect of introns on cell survival is.\n",
      "We reviewed here putative functional roles of introns in various cellular processes such as splicing, mRNA transport, NMD, and expression regulation.\n",
      "Besides, introns may give some advantages as a mutational buffer in eukaryotic genomes protecting coding sequences from being affected by randomly occurring deleterious mutations.\n",
      "Introns occupy about 40% on average of the total length of genes, which means that most randomly occurring mutations will fall into intron regions, and do not affect protein sequences and functions.\n",
      "However, it is not clear how extensively and strongly this buffering effect of intron regions might have evolutionary advantages for intron retention against the pressure of removing cellular burdens.\n",
      "Taken together, introns are clearly not junk, and they provide selective advantages to cells to be evolutionarily maintained, nevertheless, it has expensive energetic costs.\n",

      "In this review, we introduce routine RNA-seq workflow together with related software, focusing particularly on transcriptome reconstruction and expression quantification.\n",
      "The transcriptome is the entire set of RNA transcripts in a given cell for a specific developmental stage or physiological condition [1].\n",
      "Understanding the transcriptome is necessary for interpreting the functional elements of the genome as well as for understanding the underlying mechanisms of development and disease.\n",
      "Microarray technologies have been used for high-throughput large-scale RNA-level studies, such as to identify differentially expressed genes between developmental stages or between healthy and diseased groups [2].\n",
      "However, its hybridization- based nature limits the ability to catalog and quantify RNA molecules expressed under various conditions.\n",
      "Advances in massive parallel DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) by sequencing of cDNA.\n",
      "RNA-seq has rapidly replaced microarray technology because of its better resolution and higher reproducibility; this method can be used to extend our knowledge of alternative splicing events [3], novel genes and transcripts [4], and fusion transcripts [5].\n",
      "One concern regarding the application of RNA-seq is abundance estimation at the gene-level and transcript-level differential expression under distinct conditions.\n",
      "Routine RNA-seq workflow may consist of the following five steps as shown in Fig.1: (1) preprocessing of raw data, (2) read alignment, (3) transcriptome reconstruction, (4) expression quantification, and (5) differential expression analysis.\n",
      "As an initial step, RNA-seq data may be subjected to quality control (QC) of the raw data before data analysis.\n",
      "Similar to whole genome or exome sequencing, read alignment can be performed to map the reads to the reference genome or transcriptome.\n",
      "Clinical samples including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimen and cancer tissue biopsies are often degraded or exist in limited amount [6].\n",

      "Next, transcriptome reconstruction is carried out to identify all transcripts expressed in a specimen based on read mapping data.\n",
      "If there is no available reference sequence, this procedure can be conducted directly using a de novo assembly approach.\n",
      "Once all transcripts are identified, their abundances can be estimated using read mapping data.\n",
      "Finally, differential expression analysis is conducted using currently available programs.\n",
      "In this review, we discuss the RNA-seq workflow and its related bioinformatics tools in each step (Table 1), focusing on transcriptome reconstruction and abundance quantification.\n",
      "Similarly to whole genome or exome sequencing, RNAseq data is formatted in FASTQ (sequence and base quality).\n",
      "Numerous erroneous sequence variants can be introduced during the library preparation, sequencing, and imaging steps [7], which should be identified and filtered out in the data analysis step.\n",
      "Thus, QC of raw data should be performed as the initial step of routine RNA-seq workflow.\n",
      "Tools such as FastQC [8] and HTQC [9] can be applied in this step to assess the quality of raw data, enabling assessment of the overall and per-base quality for each read (i.e., read 1 and 2 in case of paired-end sequencing) in each sample.\n",
      "Depending on the RNA-seq library construction strategy, some form of read trimming may be advisable prior to aligning the RNA-seq data.\n",
      "Two common trimming strategies include \"adapter trimming\" and \"quality trimming.\"\n",
      "Adapter trimming involves removal of the adapter sequence by masking specific sequences used during library construction.\n",
      "Quality trimming generally removes the ends of reads where base quality scores have decreased to a level such that sequence errors and the resulting mismatches prevent reads from aligning.\n",
      "The adapter trimming step is typically not necessary, as most recent sequencers provide raw data in which the adapters are already trimmed.\n",
      "In contrast, quality trimming may be an essential step depending on the analysis strategy used.\n",
      "The FASTX-Toolkit [10] and FLEXBAR [11] are useful for this purpose.\n",
      "There are two strategies in which a genome or transcriptome is used as a reference for the read alignment step [12].\n",
      "The transcriptome comprises all transcripts in a given specimen and in which splicing has been conducted by including the exons and excluding the introns.\n",
      "If a transcriptome is used as a reference, unspliced aligners that do not allow large gaps may be the proper choice for accurate read mapping.\n",

      "Of the metrics, sequencing depth is importance, because it allows users to determine if current RNA-seq data is suitable for such application including expression profiling, alternative splicing analysis, novel isoform identification, and transcriptome reconstruction by checking whether the sequencing depth is saturated or not.\n",
      "Qualimap 2 [22] is consisted of four analysis modes: BAM QC, Counts QC, RNA-seq QC, and Multi-sample BAM QC.\n",
      "Compared to previous release, this version focuses on multi-sample QC for high-throughput sequencing data.\n",
      "Multi-sample BAM QC mode allows combined QC for multiple alignment files, which takes the metrics from the single-sample BAM QC mode as input.\n",

      "First, the reference-guided approach consists of two sequential steps: (1) alignment of raw reads to the reference as described in the previous section and (2) assembly of overlapping reads for reconstructing transcripts.\n",
      "This approach is advantageous when reference annotation information is well-known, such as in human and mouse, which is employed in Cufflinks [24], Scripture [25], and StringTie [26].\n",
      "Second, the reference-independent approach uses a de novo assembly algorithm to directly build consensus transcripts from short reads without reference, which is useful when there is no known reference genome or transcriptome.\n",
      "Trinity [27], Oases [28], and transABySS [29] may be used for this purpose.\n",
      "Two publications have described RNA-seq protocols: one is de novo transcriptome reconstruction without reference using the Trinity platform [30] and the other is differential expression analysis of a gene and transcript using a combination of TopHat and Cufflinks [31].\n",
      "The latter protocol also includes a transcriptome reconstruction procedure (using Cufflinks) from read mapping data to a reference genome (using TopHat).\n",
      "These protocols are good examples of different strategies that can be used for transcriptome reconstruction according to the presence or absence of a reference sequence.\n",
      "Numerous methods have been developed for expression quantification using RNA-seq data.\n",
      "The methods are grouped into two according to the target levels: gene- and isoform-level quantification.\n",
      "Alternative expression analysis by sequencing (ALEXA-seq) [32], enhanced read analysis of gene expression (ERANGE) [33], and normalization by expected uniquely mappable area (NEUMA) [34] support gene-level quantification.\n",
      "Isoform-level quantification methods are divided into three groups according to the reference type and requirement of alignment results.\n",
      "The first group (e.g., RSEM [35]) requires the alignment result of reads using the transcriptome as a reference.\n",
      "The second group (e.g., Cufflinks [24] and StringTie [26]) also requires alignment results of reads using whole genome sequences as a reference rather than the transcriptome.\n",
      "The last group (e.g., Sailfish [36]) uses an alignment-free method.\n",
      "We discuss each isoform-level quantification method in detail in the following sections.\n",
      "RSEM is software that quantifies transcript-level abundance from RNA-seq data.\n",
      "RSEM is operated in two steps: (1) generation and preprocessing of a set of reference transcript sequences and (2) alignment of reads to the reference transcripts followed by estimation of transcript abundances and their credibility intervals.\n",
      "A FASTA formatted file of transcript sequences is used to generate the reference transcripts, which can be obtained from a reference genome database, a de novo transcriptome assembler, or an Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database.\n",
      "Alternatively, a gene annotation file in GTF format and the full genome sequence in FASTA format may be supplied.\n",
      "RSEM uses the Bowtie alignment program [15].\n",
      "A user-provided aligner can be used for mapping RNA-seq reads using reference transcripts.\n",
      "RSEM provides gene-level and isoform-level estimates as the primary output by computing maximum likelihood abundance estimates based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm after read mapping.\n",
      "Abundance estimates are given in terms of two measures: an estimate of the number of fragments and the estimated fraction of transcripts comprising a given isoform or gene.\n",
      "The latter estimates can be multiplied by 10-6 to obtain a measure of transcripts per million (TPM).\n",
      "RSEM also supports the visualization of alignment and read depth using a genome browser such as the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser.\n",
      "The Tuxedo package is the most widely used software for transcript assembly and quantification using RNA-seq and consists of a number of different programs, including TopHat, Cufflinks, and Cuffdiff [31].\n",
      "In the initial step, TopHat is employed for mapping raw RNA-seq reads to a reference genome, where some reads can be spliced when they were aligned on the exon-exon junctions of transcripts.\n",
      "These mapped reads are provided as input to Cufflinks for transcript assembly and abundance estimation.\n",
      "Transcript assembly is achieved by building an overlap graph from the mapped reads followed by computing minimal path cover in the overlap graph, generating a minimum number of transcripts that will explain all reads in the graph.\n",
      "Abundance estimation is performed by estimating the maximum likelihood abundance based on transcript coverage and compatibility together with the use of fragment length distribution.\n",
      "Abundances are reported in fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM) for paired-end and RPKM for a single-end.\n",
      "Cuffdiff, a part of the Cufflinks package, also uses the mapped reads to report genes and transcripts that are differentially expressed.\n",
      "CummeRbund can produce figures and plots from the Cuffdiff outputs.\n",
      "StringTie is software used for transcriptome reconstruction and abundance estimation.\n",
      "Similarly to other tools, including Cufflinks, spliced aligners such as TopHat2 [37] or GSNAP [19] are used to directly align RNA-seq reads or subsequent alignment after generating pre-assembled contigs from the reads using a de novo assembler such as MaSurCa [38].\n",
      "StringTie can perform transcriptome reconstruction and abundance estimation simultaneously by building a flow network for the path of the heaviest coverage and computing the maximum flow to estimate abundance.\n",
      "StringTie reports estimated abundance in FPKM for paired-end and RPKM for single-end.\n",
      "Sailfish is unique software adopting an alignment-free approach for isoform quantification.\n",
      "An index is built from a set of reference transcripts and a specific choice of k-mer length, which consists of data structures that maps each k-mer in the reference transcripts to a unique integer identifier, enabling to count k-mers in a set of reads and to resolve their origin in the set of transcripts.\n",
      "Until the set of reference transcripts or the k-mer length is changed, it is not necessary to rebuild the index.\n",
      "Sailfish computes an estimate of the relative abundance of each transcript in the reference by employing an EM algorithm similar to that used in RSEM.\n",
      "Because Sailfish avoids read alignment entirely, the running time for quantification is much lower than for other existing methods.\n",
      "Sailfish reports terms of abundance measures, including (1) RPKM, (2) k-mers per kilobase per million mapped k-mers (KPKM), and (3) TPM.\n",
      "We described four programs, RSEM, Cufflinks, StringTie, and Sailfish in detail.\n",
      "In addition to the use of specific algorithm, a major difference between these programs may be the reference type used.\n",
      "A set of transcript sequences is used as a reference in RSEM and Sailfish, indicating that the programs may be suitable for estimating the abundance of known transcripts.\n",
      "In contrast, a reference genome is employed in Cufflinks and StringTie, making it possible to present the estimated abundance of novel transcripts as well as already known transcripts, as spliced read mapping data can reveal known and novel splice junction information simultaneously.\n",
      "For differential expression analysis, a number of software packages and pipelines have been developed including edgeR [39], DESeq [40], NOIseq [23], SAMseq [41], Cuffdiff [24], and EBSeq [42].\n",
      "Unlike edgeR and DESeq, which adopt negative binomial models, and NOIseq and SAMseq, which are non-parametric, Cuffdiff and EBSeq can be used to compare differentially expressed genes by employing transcript-based detection methods.\n",
      "Many of the programs accept read count data as input, which can be produced by using HTSeq [43] or BEDTools [44].\n",
      "Similarly to Cuffdiff, Ballgown program [45] is employed for differential expression analysis using read mapping data from StringTie [26] (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/index.shtml?t=manual).\n",
      "The above programs adopt one or more of the several available normalization methods (total count, upper quartile, median, DESeq normalization, trimmed mean of M values, quantile and RPKM normalization) to correct biases that may appear between samples (sequencing depth [33]) or within sample (gene length [46] and GC contents [45]).\n",
      "Although many programs have been developed, one research group reported that there may be large differences between these programs and that no single method may be optimal under all experimental conditions [48].\n",
      "Thus, it may be difficult for most of users with no or weak statistical background to select a proper method.\n",
      "However, because RNA-seq data sets are rapidly accumulating, we expect that new bioinformatics tools for differential expression will be developed, which will function robustly under a wide range of conditions.\n",
      "Numerous bioinformatics programs have been developed for RNA-seq data analysis.\n",
      "Even tools developed for a same purpose are based on distinct approaches using different algorithms and models.\n",
      "The diversity of the methodology makes it possible to customize analysis protocols by choosing a program that provides the best fit to each specific goal.\n",
      "In this review, we described the routine RNA-seq analysis workflow, focusing on transcriptome reconstruction and expression quantification, and also introduced its related bioinformatics programs.\n",
      "Therefore, we expect that this review will be helpful for preparing a specific pipeline for RNA-seq data analysis, enabling to design new biological experiments.\n",
      "Typical workflow for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis.\n",
      "This workflow shows an example for expression quantification and differential expression analysis at gene and/or transcript level using RNA-seq, which is typically consisted of five steps as following: preprocessing, read alignment, transcriptome reconstruction, expression quantification and differential expression analysis.\n",
      "For each step, currently available programs are written in Table 1.\n",

      "Interestingly, the 22 cancers also expressed the G64 genes in a correlated manner, as observed previously in an LADC study.\n",
      "Considering that gene expression levels were continuous among different tumor samples, tumor subpopulations were investigated using extreme expressional ranges of G64—i.e., tumor subpopulation with the lowest 15% of G64 expression, tumor subpopulation with the highest 15% of G64 expression, and tumor subpopulation with intermediate expression.\n",
      "In each of the 22 cancers, we examined whether patient survival was different among the three different subgroups and found that G64 could differentiate tumor subpopulations in six other cancers, including sarcoma, kidney, brain, liver, and esophageal cancers.\n",
      "Different tumors or cancers in different patients have distinct genetic and cellular profiles, including kinds of genetic mutations, patterns of gene expression, and metastatic potential, which is often called cancer heterogeneity.\n",

      "\n",
      "The G64 genes were originally identified by their coregulated expression pattern in single cells derived from a single LADC tumor region [10].\n",
      "Interestingly, we have reported that 488 LADC patients samples downloaded from the TCGA were also separated into two distinct groups by the G64 genes.\n",
      "In the present work, we examined whether G64 could be a classifier for other cancers, as well.\n",
      "For this analysis, 22 RNA-seq-based transcriptome data with a sample size ≥150 were retrieved from the TCGA.\n",
      "The threshold of 150 was selected, because it was considered to be the minimum number of samples for statistical tests between different groups (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).\n",
      "As done in the previous LADC study [10], heat map analysis was performed for each cancer type to see how patient samples were separated by G64 (Supplementary Fig.1).\n",
      "As shown in Supplementary Fig.1, the co-regulated patterns of G64 expression were confirmed in all types of cancers we tested.\n",
      "However, distinct two-group separations were not as evident as the case for LADC.\n",
      "Therefore, we classifies patient samples further into three different categories by using a 15% extreme threshold of G64 expression (Supplementary Fig.2): the highest 15% group, the lowest 15% group, and an intermediate group.\n",
      "For this purpose, the patients were sorted out by the intensity of the average FPKM values of the G64 genes expressed in each patient.\n",
      "As a result, for instance, among a total of 531 kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) samples, 160 samples were assigned into the two extreme groups—the highest 15% and the lowest 15%—whereas the remaining 371 samples were classified into the intermediate group.\n",

      "Patient survival rates were compared among the three patient groups for each of the 22 cancers.\n",
      "As done in the LADC study, we performed Kaplan-Meier analysis using the patients' survival data obtained from the TCGA in each type of cancer.\n",
      "Survival rates were compared between the lowest 15% versus highest 15% groups (i.e., P1 comparison in Table 1), the lowest 15% versus intermediate groups (i.e., P2 comparison in Table 1), and the intermediate versus highest 15% groups (i.e., P3 comparison in Table 1).\n",
      "PCA confirmed the groups' separations by G64 expression (Fig.1, Supplementary Fig.3, 4, 5, 6, 7).\n",
      "As summarized in Table 1, only six cancers were shown to have statistically significant differences between groups, including KIRC, brain lower grade glioma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal papilloma cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and sarcoma.\n",
      "In all comparisons between groups in these 6 cancers, G64 up-regulation was consistently observed to be associated with worse patient prognosis in the Cox regression analysis (Fig.1, Supplementary Fig.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).\n",
      "The 22 cancers were subsequently divided into two batches: i.e., six survival-differentiating cancers and 16 survivalnon- differentiating cancers.\n",
      "After the RNA-seq samples from the 22 cancers were collected as separate batches, we examined the aspect of survival difference by G64 expression in each batch.\n",
      "Consequently, the survival-differentiating batch, mixing up six different cancer samples (531 + 514 + 351 + 289 + 184 + 257 = 2,126 samples), clearly maintained the survival differentiation among the lowest 15%, the highest 15%, and the intermediate groups (Fig.2), whereas the survival-non-differentiating batch, mixing up 16 different cancer samples (178 + 373 + 302 + ….\n",

      "Taken together, the G64 genes can differentiate cancer samples by their survival rate differences in cancers other than LADC.\n",
      "Basically, it was an interesting finding that genes, named the G64 module in our previous study (i.e., a highly coregulated gene group), can classify not only single cells derived from a single tumor but also tumors that have originated from several different cancers.\n",
      "Various biomarkers have been identified and developed for molecular diagnostics in cancers.\n",
      "In fact, numerous genes included in the list of the G64 module have already been identified as cancer diagnostic or prognostic markers by several independent researchers [141516].\n",
      "For instance, CDCA5 and NCAPH have been characterized to be highly expressed in lung cancers [1718].\n",
      "Our previous study showed that cell cycle genes were a main functional GO category in the G64 module.\n",
      "Consistently, dysregulation of the cell cycle has long been proven to be a critical process causing cancers [19202122].\n",
      "However, to our knowledge, it was the first finding ever that G64 genes were co-regulated in various cancers, and patient prognosis can be differentiated by these genes.\n",
      "Here, we clearly showed that the G64 module can be a good biomarker, predicting cancer prognosis at least for six different cancers—i.e., seven different cancers if LADC is included.\n",
      "It is unclear what common molecular characteristics the seven cancers (i.e., 6 cancers in the present study and LADC) share together other than co-regulated G64 expression.\n",
      "The seven cancers must be initiated and progress by different genetic or environmental causes and pathways, and there is no proper explanation for the common subpopulation differentiation carried through G64 expression.\n",
      "It is also hard to explain at this moment why the 64 genes are co-regulated on an inter-tumoral level and intra-tumoral level and why up-regulating patients tend to have a poor prognosis.\n",
      "One possibility we can think of is that expression of these genes may be associated with drug metabolism, contributing to drug sensitivity or drug resistance.\n",
      "It will be interesting to study further how expression of G64 is changed during the recurrence of cancers.\n",
      "Taken together, G64 genes would be a good candidate of developing prognostic markers for multiple cancers.\n",

      "Previous studies in Holstein have shown 35% to 51.8% heritability in milk production traits, such as milk yield, fat, and protein, using pedigree data.\n",
      "Other studies in complex human traits could be captured by common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and their genetic variations, attributed to chromosomes, are in proportion to their length.\n",
      "Using genome-wide estimation and partitioning approaches, we analyzed three quantitative Holstein traits relevant to milk production in Korean Holstein data harvested from 462 individuals genotyped for 54,609 SNPs.\n",
      "For all three traits (milk yield, fat, and protein), we estimated a nominally significant (p = 0.1) proportion of variance explained by all SNPs on the Illumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip (h2G).\n",
      "These common SNPs explained approximately most of the narrow-sense heritability.\n",
      "Longer genomic regions tended to provide more phenotypic variation information, with a correlation of 0.46~0.53 between the estimate of variance explained by individual chromosomes and their physical length.\n",
      "These results suggested that polygenicity was ubiquitous for Holstein milk production traits.\n",
      "These results will expand our knowledge on recent animal breeding, such as genomic selection in Holstein.\n",
      "New-generation sequencing technologies have substantially enhanced the development of genomic tools to assist in breeding decisions.\n",
      "Among many techniques, genotyping technologies have enabled breeders or researchers to identify DNA regions or quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with a particular phenotypic trait of domesticated animals.\n",
      "Especially, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and QTL associated with Holstein complex traits, including economic traits related to milk production, were investigated in the approximate 10-year wave of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [123].\n",
      "In the near past, researchers discovered genetic markers and created marker panels for use in performing marker-assisted selection (MAS).\n",
      "Although MAS provided a first genomic approach to achieve breeding goals to animal breeders, the domesticated animal genome in MAS was taken lightly with narrow perspectives.\n",
      "MAS is restricted when it comes to predicting animal capacity, as it depends on a small number of QTLs that are tagged by markers associated with each trait [4].\n",
      "Additionally, the gap between the proportion of phenotypic variance accounted for by the top SNPs that reach genome-wide significance level in a GWAS and the heritability estimated from pedigree analyses remained unexplained for most complex traits of human.\n",
      "This was called the missing heritability problem [5], explanations to which have been debated in the field [6].\n",
      "Recent studies using whole-genome estimation approaches demonstrated that a large proportion of heritability for complex traits of humans can be captured by all common SNPs on current genotyping arrays.\n",
      "It implies that there are a large number of variants with an effect that is too small to pass the stringent genome-wide significance level.\n",
      "In animal breeding, genomics selection (GS) has been developed to overcome restriction factors of MAS; it has covered a large number of variants containing small effects.\n",
      "The fundamental difference between MAS and GS as important animal selection tools is that scale GS embraces a much larger number of markers than MAS in predicting animal capacity.\n",
      "GS uses a dense set of markers from across the entire genome to use all markers containing SNPs with small effects.\n",
      "This feature gives GS a profound advantage over MAS.\n",
      "For predictions based on genomic data for humans, a previous study has already estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance.\n",
      "It was elucidated by the common SNPs all together on a genotyping array for a range of quantitative traits in a large homogenous human sample, using the whole-genome estimation and partitioning approaches [7].\n",
      "The novelty of our research lies in animal capacity prediction based on genomic data due to the fact that animal evaluation is a core content in the breeding industry.\n",
      "Finally, to conduct our animal breeding research on polygenic inheritance, which was likely to be ubiquitous for complex Holstein traits associated with milk production traits, the genomic selection technique was performed along with various different analyses.\n",

      "When we estimated genetic variance using SNP data, we have to consider seasonal effects (winter, December–February; spring, March–May; summer, June–August; and autumn, September–November based on birth date) as environmental effects, because milk production traits are closely related to season.\n",
      "Then, we performed ANOVA test to investigate the relationship between each trait (parity 1 and 2) and seasonal effect.\n",

      "We counted on seasonal effect in only the analysis including milk fat.\n",
      "In addition, using the same method as above but allowing multiple genetic components to be fit simultaneously in the model, we partitioned h2G into the contributions of genic (h2Gg) and intergenic (h2Gi) regions of the whole genome across all traits.\n",

      "These data were collected from 462 cows recruited from 63 farms in South Korea, genotyped at 54,609 SNPs on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip.\n",
      "There were 462 individuals and 41,099 autosomal SNPs after quality control (Methods section).\n",
      "All individuals were measured for three traits (milk yield, milk fat, and milk protein), which were related to milk production.\n",
      "The phenotypic correlations between pairwise traits are visualized in Supplementary Fig.1.\n",
      "Correlations between milk yield and milk protein were much stronger than other pairwise comparisons.\n",
      "We estimated the proportion of variance explained by fitting all SNPs in a mixed linear model for each of the three traits.\n",
      "In general, there was a substantial amount of variance explained by all autosomal SNPs after quality control on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (σ2G) for three traits of the records of two parities, with a mean of 43.51% (a range from 36.3 to 47%) across all three traits of the records of two parities (Table 1).\n",
      "In the records, the estimate of h2G was non-zero and reached the nominal significance level (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.05).\n",
      "We compared the estimates of h2G with the narrow-sense heritability h2, estimated from pedigree analyses in the literature based on Canada Holstein.\n",
      "The value of h2G was similar to h2 from pedigree analysis in the literature, and all common SNPs explained most (average, 43.51%; range from 36.3% to 47%) of the narrow-sense heritability (average, 41.38%; range from 36.3% to 47%), despite the estimates of h2 being from different country populations (Table 1).\n",
      "In contrast, when we performed a genome-wide association analysis in the same sample, we tried to identify genome-wide-significant (Bonfferoni correction p = 0.05) SNPs for three traits of parity 1.\n",
      "Three SNPs and one SNP were significant in milk yield and fat, respectively, and there were no significant SNPs for milk protein (Supplementary Fig.2).\n",
      "We hypothesized that there was a major reason for only a few significant large-effect SNPs associated with Holstein traits related to milk production.\n",
      "First of all, many SNPs with small effects affected the three traits related to milk production.\n",
      "Second, according to previous studies, there are many common variants associated with the traits in humans at a nominally significant level, but their effect sizes are too small to be genome-wide-significant [7].\n",
      "Using the same method as above but allowing multiple genetic components to be fit simultaneously in the model, we then partitioned h2G into the contributions of individual chromosomes for each of the three traits of two parities and plotted the estimate of variance explained by each chromosome (h2C) against the chromosome length for each trait.\n",
      "In a previous study, no linear correlation between h2C and chromosome length for any particular traits was observed for most traits in humans as strongly as shown in the other studies.\n",
      "Then, the average value of estimates of h2G over all of tens traits to reduce the sampling error variance, and the average estimated h2C was strongly correlated with chromosome length.\n",
      "However, we dealt with only three traits related to milk production, and we aimed to identify a linear correlation between h2C and chromosome length for each trait.\n",
      "The squared correlation between h2C and chromosome length using trait information of parity 1 was 0.46, 0.532, and 0.509 for milk yield, fat, and protein, respectively (Fig.2).\n",
      "The regression slope of the proportion of the genetic variance attributed to each chromosome on the proportion of the genome represented by each chromosome was significant (p<0.1), suggesting a proportional relationship between genome length and genetic variance in Holstein.\n",
      "Consistent results were achieved from myriad genetic variants, each possessing a small effect throughout the widespread whole genome in Holstein.\n",
      "In addition, we partitioned h2G into the contributions of genic (h2Gg) and intergenic (h2Gi) regions of the whole genome (Methods section).\n",
      "We estimated the variance explained by the genic (h2Cg) and intergenic (h2Ci) regions of each chromosome.\n",
      "The numbers of genic and intergenic SNPs on each chromosome are presented in Supplementary Table 2.\n",
      "We showed that the variance explained by the genic (intergenic) regions on each chromosome is also proportional to the total length of the genic (intergenic) regions (Fig.3).\n",
      "Previous studies using the whole-genome estimation approach have shown that common SNPs explicate a large proportion of heritability for traits in human [1012].\n",
      "The reason why GWASs in this field have not yet identified all common SNPs that contain information on the amount of variation is mainly that many peculiar effects are too small to pass the stringent genome-wide significance level.\n",
      "Therefore, we hypothesized that inheritance of Korean Holstein milk production traits would consist of a lot of genetic variants with small effects.\n",
      "Finally, we estimated and partitioned the genetic variance that met certain conditions, tagged by all common SNPs for three complex traits related to milk production and showing ubiquitous polygenic inheritance of Korean Holstein.\n",
      "The estimates of h2G for three traits were different from 0 at the significance level (p<0.1).\n",
      "The estimate of h2G for milk yield of parity 1 was 43.0% (SE = 10.3%), which was smaller than the estimate from a study in Canada (h2G = 52%) [13].\n",
      "There could be three possible reasons: (1) There is a difference in the reference population size between Korea and Canada.\n",
      "In fact, Koreans import a lot of Canada Holstein semen, but the present reference population is smaller than Canada.\n",
      "(2) The Korean environment is different from Canada.\n",
      "(3) We can consider only one environmental effect (season) due to data size in this study.\n",
      "The estimate for milk fat (h2G = 47.0%, SE = 10.1%) and protein (h2G = 44.3%, SE = 10.2%) in Korea was larger than in Canada (fat h2G = 36.9%, protein h2G = 42.3%).\n",
      "It is demonstrated by the genome partitioning analysis that there was a significant linear relationship between the estimates of variance explained by individual chromosomes and chromosome length (Fig.2).\n",
      "If we define the genic region as ±0 kb of the UTRs, the correlation between variance explained and chromosome length was stronger in the intergenic regions than in the genic regions (Fig.3).\n",
      "A previous study showed by a number of analyses that the result in this was driven neither by the difference between the number of SNPs in genic regions and in intergenic regions nor by the difference in MAF distribution between genic and intergenic SNPs [7].\n",
      "If trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in functional elements, such as introns and UTRs, and diluted in exons, the relationship between the explained variance and DNA length will be attenuated in the genic region, as in human.\n",
      "However, it could possibly be just a sampling problem.\n",
      "Because our data size was smaller than our expectancy, some chromosomes did not reach the significance level (p = 0.01) in the genome partitioning analysis.\n",
      "In the genome partitioning analysis for milk yield using SNPs in the intergenic region and milk protein using SNPs in the genic region, the linear regression results were also insignificant, and we could identify some outliers.\n",
      "Moreover, when these outliers were removed, the linear regression results were significant (E in Fig.3).\n",
      "We hypothesize that some chromosomes could have a slightly larger effect than our expectation, based on the fitted line in special cases (chromosome 17 or 4 in milk protein).\n",
      "We showed by whole-genome estimation and partitioning analyses that Holstein milk production traits appeared to be highly polygenic, which means that there were a large number of genetic variants segregating in the population with a small effect widely distributed across the whole genome.\n",
      "All common SNPs expressed most of the heritability on average over all 3 traits analyzed in this study.\n",
      "The slight, remaining unexplained heritability could be due to causal variants, including common and rare ones that are not well tagged by SNPs on this Illumina SNP chip, or possibly because the heritability was over-estimated in the pedigree study.\n",
      "In conclusion, heritability consists of many variants with small effects for Holstein milk production traits in Korea.\n",

      "Through detailed and diligent analysis of promoter regions, researchers will be able to uncover new and significant information about transcription initiation and gene function.\n",
      "Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells contain important gene-regulating elements, located within promoter regions [12].\n",
      "It is known that promoter sequences possess special signatures to distinguish them from the rest of the genome sequences.\n",
      "A few core promoter elements have been detected, of which the most common elements are the CpG island, TATA box, initiator (Inr), downstream promoter element (DPE), and TFIIB recognition element (BRE) [2], but these promoter elements may not be universal.\n",
      "Recently, a group from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project published chromatic maps to mark histone modifications within nine cells of different types from the human genome, drawn from the results from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of these same cells [12].\n",
      "From each of these nine cells, Ernst et al.\n",
      "[34] published 15 chromatin states of the human genome.\n",
      "Among them, the first three states represent promoter regions: state 1 (Active_Promoter), state 2 (Weak_Promoter), and state 3 (Poised_Promoter).\n",
      "The information gained from the exploration of promoter elements and transcription starting sites will enable researchers to produce more accurate promoter prediction algorithms, which in turn will yield deeper insight into the process of transcription initiation and gene functions.\n",
      "Here, we publish frequency profiles of the ChromHMM promoter states of the human genome, at 200bp intervals, paying particular attention to the existence of promoter elements, such as CpG islands, TATA boxes, Inr, DPE, and recognition elements from the transcription factors that bind with polymerase II (BRE) (signal features), together with transcription starting sites, in terms of size, overlapping patterns, and locations.\n",
      "Ernst et al.\n",
      "[4] applied unsupervised learning methods to convert the Broad Histone track's results from ChIP-seq analyses into specific points that indicate promoter regions on chromatin maps for 15 chromatin elements within the genome.\n",
      "These 15 chromatin states were chosen because of their rich biological content, as well their well-established presence in previous research [4].\n",
      "The resulting files are hosted by the ENCODE Analysis Data Hub, which is available for public download under the ENCODE Data Release Policy (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/downloads.html).\n",
      "We downloaded the BED files for the chromatin signal tracks of the nine ENCODE cell types.\n",
      "Within them, chromatin states 1, 2, and 3 represent Active, Weak, and Posed Promoters, respectively, which differ only in regard to the levels of expression in various biological assays.\n",
      "These states were defined, based purely on 9 chromatin marks, and their input controls across 9 cell types.\n",
      "Depending upon the cell type, slight variances were found, as seen in Table 1.\n",
      "For example, the gm12878 cell line has an active promoter consisting of 14,674 blocks and occupies 0.80% of the whole genome, whereas k562 has 14,951 blocks and occupies 0.68% of the whole genome, for chromatin state 1.\n",
      "To overcome this slight variance in cell lines, we divided the promoter regions uniformly at 200-bp resolution, regardless of the 9 cell line block boundaries.\n",
      "Fig.1 shows our Java code, which relies on Java's Oracle interface (Oracle Database 12c Standard Edition) and implements regular expressions, based on predefined classes from the java.util.regex package, in order to pattern-match different promoter elements, such as CpG islands, TATA boxs, Inr, DPE, and BRE, for each 200-bp window.\n",
      "The code also builds upon formal grammar rules based on the structural properties seen in promoter sequences, though these patterns usually apply only to the core promoters [56].\n",
      "Our Java code produces an output profile consisting of the 18 required fields as follows (Fig.2).\n",
      "The first three fields are: the name of the chromosome, the starting position of the feature in the chromosome, and the ending position.\n",
      "The next four fields represent the frequencies of the 4 promoter elements.\n",
      "For example, Fig.2 shows that the nucleotide sequences starting from 28337 to 23537 (200 bp) in chromosome 1 contains 1 occurrence of a TATA box, 6 occurrences of Inr, 0 occurrences of BRE, and 6 occurrences of DPE.\n",
      "The next 9 fields indicate the ChromHMM annotation of 9 cell lines (K562, GM12878, H1HESC, HEPG2, HMEC, HSMM, HUVEC, NHEK, and NHLF).\n",
      "The last two fields indicate the existence of DataBase of Human Transcription Start Sites (dbTSS) data [78], and the GC ratio, respectively, where the hg19promoter file for dbTSS data was used for indexing (ftp://ftp.hgc.jp/pub/hgc/db/dbtss/dbtss_ver8/Sanger_data/).\n",
      "Table 2 shows the summary of our promoter frequency profile.\n",
      "The data show significants difference from the known statistical factors of core promoters.\n",
      "It is due to the fact that we divided the regions into 200 bp lengths whereas the core promoter elements are known to exist typically within 50 bp (base pairs) upstream to 50 bp downstream of the TSS [2], and that we are including the Poised_Promoter state of the ChromHMM.\n",
      "From the ChromHMM human promoter blocks, the results of our statistical survey on 176,579 units show that DPE sequences have the highest frequency among the four chosen motifs in promoter elements, appearing in about 97.1% of the ChromHMM promoter regions, meanwhile Inr is seen in 92% of promoter regions, and BRE is seen in only 17.3% of the promoters (It is known that Inr usually occurs only about half of the human promoters [3]).\n",
      "TATA boxes are found in 52.2% of the ChromHMM promoter blocks.\n",
      "Some contextual patterns have been recognized for certain promoter elements.\n",
      "For example, we can expect to find BREs within GC-rich areas, meanwhile areas with TATA boxes are typically GC-poor.\n",
      "In total, there are 9,435 ChromHMM promoter blocks in the dbTSS locations (approximately 5.34%).\n",
      "The number of 200-bp blocks that contain all four promoter elements was 176,579.\n",
      "Among them, only 9,436 of the blocks contain dbTSS data [78].\n",
      "Some of the blocks showed distinct associations with dbTSS data.\n",
      "For example, the promoter blocks that do not contain any of the promoter elements tend to have a higher GC ratio (0.68) where a dbTSS location exists.\n",

      "Title: Small Non-coding Transfer RNA-Derived RNA Fragments (tRFs): Their Biogenesis, Function and Implication in Human Diseases\n",
      "\n",
      "tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).\n",
      "A growing number of reports have shown that tRFs are not random degradation products but are functional ncRNAs made of specific tRNA cleavage.\n",
      "They play regulatory roles in several biological contexts such as cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders.\n",
      "In this review, we summarize the biogenesis and functions of tRFs.\n",
      "It is now well known that mammalian genomes encode, in addition to protein-coding genes, RNA molecules that have no protein-coding capacity, and thus are referred to as non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [1].\n",
      "Recent high throughput sequencing data suggest that there are about four times as many ncRNA transcripts as there are protein-coding RNA transcripts in human cells.\n",
      "While some ncRNAs, such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and those well-studied ones including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are recognized as functional molecules, the majority of ncRNAs and their biological roles in mammals are underappreciated, as evolution would have favored against such gratuitous and wasteful transcription [2].\n",
      "However, accumulating evidence has exhibited a remarkable degree of their involvement in many biological events including cell proliferation, cellular stress responses, host immune responses and virus replication [3456].\n",
      "Based on their size, ncRNAs are classified into long, medium, and small ones.\n",
      "Those longer than 200 nucleotides (nt) are termed as long (or large) ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and include the majority of nuclear ncRNAs.\n",
      "Those ranging 40-200 nt are medium-sized ncRNAs including many classic ncRNAs such as 5S rRNA, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), etc.\n",
      "ncRNAs shorter than 40 nt are termed small ncRNAs (sncRNAs) that have been extensively studied in the last two decades and will be elaborated in the next section.\n",
      "In this review, we will focus on a recently discovered class of sncRNAs called tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs), as data from several groups including those from us suggested them to be emerging functional molecules.\n",
      "The functionality of ncRNAs was initially bolstered by the discovery showing that sncRNAs are capable of mediating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing [7].\n",
      "The most extensively studied among them are miRNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-transcriptionally in animals and plants [8910].\n",
      "Another class of sncRNAs is siRNAs that are closely related to miRNAs [11].\n",
      "Although naturally occurring siRNAs have been reported to be present in some mammals in addition to plants and flies [1213], siRNAs are more renowned as an experimental tool in mammalian cells.\n",
      "The gene silencing by synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and their Dicer-cleavage products (that are siRNAs) is called RNA interference (RNAi) and has been being used as a popular gene knockdown method [3].\n",
      "This technical breakthrough was well recognized and celebrated by the 2006 Nobel Prize, which was awarded to the two scientists who discovered RNAi [1415].\n",
      "A number of other sncRNAs have also been identified in various organisms [1617], including piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), repeat-associated siRNA (rasiRNA), tiny ncRNAs (tncRNA), heterochromatic small RNA (21U-RNA, hcRNA), scan RNA (scnRNA), transcription initiation RNA (tiRNA) [18], and promoter/termini-associated sRNA (PASR/TASR) [19].\n",
      "Although some of these have been shown to play roles in several biological processes such as heterochromatin formation and transposon silencing, their functions are largely unknown and detailed description of them is beyond the scope of this review [10].\n",
      "Mature tRNAs are characterized by their evolutionarily conserved secondary and tertiary structures, extensive post-transcriptional modifications (up to 100 nucleoside modifications have been described), extreme stability and resistance to nucleases [202122].\n",
      "There are more than 600 tRNA genes in humans, which are far more than needed for at most 64 anticodons and 20 amino acids [232425], suggesting gene-specific functions of tRNAs other than its traditional function in linking a codon to the cognate amino acid during translation.\n",
      "Indeed, tRFs were recently identified as a new class of sncRNAs fragmentized from tRNAs and shown to be important in regulating cell proliferation, stress-induced translational suppression, stress granule (SG) assembly, and virus replication.\n",
      "Expression of some tRFs is commonly seen among different organisms, further supporting that tRFs have emerged as important players in diverse aspects of biology.\n",
      "A mature tRNA has a 5'-monophosphate group and 3'-CCA charged with cognate amino acid.\n",
      "All properly folded tRNAs, with so called a cloverleaf structure, have four base-paired stems (in 5'–3' direction: D arm, anticodon arm, T arm, and acceptor stem) bridging the conserved D-loop, tRNA-specific anticodon loop, variable loop, and T-loop.\n",
      "Primary transcripts (pre-tRNAs) undergo several stages of maturation before becoming translation-competent tRNAs [26].\n",
      "Compared to a mature tRNA, a pre-tRNA lacks a CCA tail but includes a 5'-leader starting with triphosphate, a 3'-trailer with an oligouridine stretch and, for intron-containing tRNA, a variably-sized intron.\n",
      "The 5'- and 3'-end of a pre-tRNA are trimmed by the endonucleases RNase P and RNase Z respectively, and an intron is spliced if there is [2728].\n",
      "The 'CCA' acceptor stem must be added to the 3'-end as this is not encoded in eukaryotes [29].\n",
      "While mature, uncleaved tRNAs have a well-defined role in protein translation, multiple groups have cloned and sequenced shorter tRNA fragments [30].\n",
      "These fragments (termed \"tRFs\") identified so far can be classified into three groups; tRF-5 series whose 5'-end is aligned to the 5'-end of mature tRNA, tRF-3 series whose 3'-end is aligned to the 3'-end of mature tRNA, and tRF-1 series which is the 3'-trailer sequence in a pre-tRNA and released during 3'-end processing (Fig.1).\n",
      "Some groups have also termed the tRF-5 or tRF-3 series as tRF halves or type I [3132] and tRF1 series as type II [32].\n",
      "The tRF-5 series were the first identified class of tRFs and were usually formed by a cleavage in the D or anticodon loop of a mature tRNA.\n",
      "They have been reported in mammalian cells, plants, and fission yeast [333343536].\n",
      "As aforementioned, the tRF-3 series are those derived from the 3'-end of a mature tRNA, usually by cleavage in the T loop [332373839].\n",
      "As the 3'-end of mature tRNAs is the acceptor trinucleotide CCA, the tRF-3 series also characteristically has an end CCA.\n",
      "The tRF-1 series are undoubtedly the RNase Z cleavage product of a pre-tRNA, because their 5'-ends begin immediately after the 3'-terminus of the mature tRNA and their 3'-ends are a series of U residues that are residual from RNA polymerase III transcription run-off [3324041].\n",
      "Overall, the cleavage of tRFs is very much structure-dependent, suggesting they are not randomly degraded products.\n",
      "Other reasons supporting that tRFs are biologically meaningful include their endonuclease-specific cleavage [343442].\n",
      "The production of the tRF-5 series has been reported to be Dicer or angiogenin (ANG)-dependent in mammals [3334].\n",
      "In one case, the tRF-5 series were identified to be produced after the hybridization of the 3'-end of the human cellular tRNAlys with the HIV-1 primer binding site, raising the possibility that, at least in certain cases, tRFs may be produced when a tRNA base-pairs with another RNA molecule [38].\n",
      "It has been reported that the tRF-3 series are generated by Dicer [3238].\n",
      "In Tetrahymena, although the nuclease identity was not proven, the tRF-3 series have 5'-monophosphates that are usually left after Dicer cleavage and are in physical association with Argonaute/Piwi proteins, suggesting Dicer-mediated cleavage [39].\n",
      "The tRNA 3'-trailer sequences are thought to be rapidly degraded in the nuclear compartment soon after being cleaved from pre-tRNAs.\n",
      "Therefore, it is quite surprising that the tRF-1 series are localized mainly in the cytoplasm [341].\n",
      "There are two explanations on how the tRF-1 series bypass nuclear cleavage: (1) the tRF-1 series are exported from the nucleus by an unknown mechanism upon processing, or (2) pre-tRNAs escape nuclear quality control and are processed by cytoplasmic RNase Z.\n",
      "Biological evidence indeed supports the second possibility.\n",
      "At least in one case of a tRF-1 molecule derived from tRNASer (termed tRF-1001 [3] and Cand45 [32]), the corresponding pre-tRNA is localized in the cytoplasm [332].\n",
      "Also there are several reports supporting the cytoplasmic localization of tRNA endonucleases responsible for the tRF-1 series [343].\n",
      "Are tRFs merely by-products of tRNA degradation or nuclease off-target effects?\n",
      "Or do they have bona fide biological functions?\n",
      "If they do have functions, how diverse are these functions?\n",
      "Several lines of evidence have identified their regulatory targets, supporting that they are functional molecules [31343537].\n",
      "Although the exact roles of tRFs are further to be elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that they participate in two main types of biological processes as discussed in more detail below (Fig.2).\n",
      "tRNAs are indispensable components of the translational machinery, hence one can surmise that tRNA cleavage affects protein synthesis.\n",
      "However, the mode of translational regulation by tRNA cleavage is not simply a result of change in the mature tRNA pool available for protein synthesis.\n",
      "Ivanov et al.showed that tRNA halves generated by ANG during stress play an active role in inhibiting protein synthesis and triggering the phospho-eIF2α-independent assembly of SGs [44].\n",
      "In addition to tRNA halves, tRFs have also been reported to be involved in global translational inhibition in human cells.\n",
      "In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii a 26-nt long tRF-5 originating from tRNAVal in a stress-dependent manner was shown to directly bind to the small ribosomal subunit and reduce protein synthesis by interfering with peptidyl transferase activity [45].\n",
      "A similar mechanism of translation inhibition by a tRF-5 was also observed in human cells [46].\n",
      "A 19-nt long tRF-5 derived from tRNAGln decreased the expression of a reporter gene that did not have a sequence complementary to that of the tRF-5, suggesting that non-specific translational repression is mediated by this tRF-5.\n",
      "An interesting observation from this study was that the tRFs required a conserved \"GG\" dinucleotide for their activity in inhibiting translation.\n",
      "Because the tRF-5 series were detected in the polysome fraction, interaction of the tRF-5 with the ribosome may contribute to translation [46].\n",
      "In addition to above-mentioned translational regulation, it has become apparent that some tRFs mediate gene silencing similarly to miRNAs by binding to Argonaute family proteins [161747].\n",
      "The first tRFs suggested to be involved in the gene silencing are some tRF-5 and -3 molecules [32].\n",
      "Haussecker et al.observed that they are in association with Ago-3 and -4 and exhibit trans-gene silencing activity.\n",
      "However, this activity is much lower than that of miRNAs.\n",
      "On the other hand, some groups showed that the tRF-5 series have inefficient association with Argonautes [34] and do not exhibit detectable silencing effects [31].\n",
      "Probably the most convincing result is from our recent studies on a tRF-5 molecule derived from mature tRNAGluCTC (tRF5-GluCTC).\n",
      "Upon infection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), tRF5-GluCTC is induced robustly and plays a gene-silencing role on a target mRNA with a reverse complementary target sequence.\n",
      "In this case, the trans-silencing mechanism used by this tRF was distinct from that of canonical miRNA/siRNA.\n",
      "Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the 3'-portion of tRF5-GluCTC is critical for its gene silencing function, in contrast to miRNAs whose 5'-portion is the key determinant in target recognition [5].\n",
      "The expression of tRFs is altered in a number of pathological conditions and so those tRFs could be useful disease biomarkers.\n",
      "The involvement of tRFs in cancer, neurodegeneration and infectious disease will be discussed in the following paragraphs (Fig.2) [548].\n",
      "The role of tRFs in cancer was first reported by Lee et al3.\n",
      "One of the tRF-1 series (namely tRF-1001), derived from pre-tRNASer, is highly expressed in several cancer cell lines relative to non-proliferating normal tissues, and is required for proliferation of prostate cancer cells [3].\n",
      "The levels of tRF-1001 in cancer cells are directly related to the degree of cellular proliferation.\n",
      "Knocking down this tRF causes a dramatic loss of cell viability and inhibition of cell proliferation with specific accumulation of cells in G2 phase and inhibition of DNA synthesis [3].\n",
      "In addition, analysis of the small RNA transcriptome in prostate cancer revealed enrichment of tRFs in both non-metastatic and metastatic lymph node prostate cancer samples [3].\n",
      "The molecular mechanism by which tRF-1001 affects cell physiology is not known.\n",
      "There may be a differential processing of tRNA in prostate cancer because tRFs in non-metastatic samples were 18 nucleotides long whereas tRFs in metastatic tissues were 27 nucleotides long [49].\n",
      "The important role of tRFs in controlling cancer is also supported by the observation showing enhanced ANG expression in almost all types of cancer [505152].\n",
      "Recently, it has been shown that ANG produced tRFs that re-program translation and promote the assembly of stress granules.\n",
      "As these events help cells survive under adverse conditions, it is possible that ANG-induced tRFs may contribute to ANG-mediated cancer cell proliferation [48].\n",
      "tRFs have also been reported to help cancer cells to prevent apoptosome formation by binding to cytochrome c [53].\n",
      "Although tRNA metabolism is essential for all human cells, a number of neurological disorders are caused by defects in tRNA metabolism and tRNA processing enzymes.\n",
      "ANG mutants possessing reduced RNase activity were implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease [54].\n",
      "A subset of ALS-associated ANG mutants was also found in Parkinson's disease patients [55].\n",
      "Administration of recombinant ANG to cultured neurons protects them from stress-induced apoptosis and promotes the lifespan and motor function of SOD1 (G93A) mice, a laboratory ALS model.\n",
      "In neurons, excessive accumulation of some tRF-5 series members that are derived from a specific subset of tRNAs (Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Val, and Lys) triggers a sustained stress response leading to neuronal loss and links aberrant tRNA metabolism to the development of certain forms of intellectual disability [48].\n",
      "tRFs derived from intron-containing tRNAs are also strongly implicated in neurodegeneration [565758].\n",
      "A study on mutant mice carrying a catalytically inactive form of the RNA kinase CLP1, a component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, revealed a neurological disorder characterized by progressive loss of lower spinal motor neurons.\n",
      "Surprisingly, mutant mice accumulate a novel class of tRFs.\n",
      "In addition, homozygous missense mutations in CLP1 (R140H) were found in patients with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a heterogeneous group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by impaired development of various parts of the brain.\n",
      "These patients were identified to suffer from severe motor-sensory defects, cortical dysgenesis and microcephaly, and exhibit alterations in tRNA splicing [59].\n",
      "On the cellular level, the R140A mutation leads to the depletion of mature tRNAs, the accumulation of unspliced pre-tRNAs in patient-derived induced neurons [58] and the accumulation of linear tRNA introns [57].\n",
      "Transfection of 5'-unphosphorylated tRF corresponding to the 3'-exon of pre-tRNATyr (the natural substrate of CLP1) into patient cells results in reduced neuron survival under oxidative stress compared to the transfection of the 5'-exon, which had no effect on viability [58].\n",
      "The kinase-dead CLP1 mice accumulate 5'-leader-exon-tRFs that sensitize cells to oxidative stress and promote cell death in a p53-dependent fashion [56].\n",
      "While the exact mechanistic details on the interplay between CLP1 activity, tRNA splicing and functions of pre-tRNA-derived tRFs are yet to be uncovered, these studies provide a basis for further investigations linking aberrant tRNA metabolism and development of neurodegeneration [48].\n",
      "Viruses exploit a number of strategies to evade host immune recognition and to facilitate viral replication.\n",
      "Some of these strategies involve viral-derived or endogenous cellular ncRNAs that interact with host immune responses [60].\n",
      "We have demonstrated that RSV, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies, employs a novel mechanism to suppress antiviral responses via induction of some tRFs [561].\n",
      "We have shown that RSV infection in airway epithelial cells leads to the activation of endonuclease ANG, subsequently inducing abundant production of tRFs, most of which belong to that tRF-5 series.\n",
      "The cleavage sites by ANG are preferentially adjacent to the 5'-end of the anticodon-loop, generating tRF-5 series.\n",
      "These tRF-5s are localized exclusively in the cellular cytoplasm [5].\n",
      "At least one of the tRFs, namely tRF5-GluCTC (tRF-5 derived from tRNAGlu), has a trans-gene silencing function.\n",
      "Significantly, an antiviral target suppressed by tRF5-GluCTC downregulates RSV replication and significantly decreases the yield of infectious viral particles produced by infected cells, demonstrating a stimulatory role for tRF5-GluCTC in RSV replication [5].\n",
      "Using an elegant biochemical approach, named HITS-ABt (hIgh-throughput sequencing of RNAs associated with biotinylated tRF), to capture tRF5-GluCTC-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes combined with bioinformatics analysis, we have identified a number of potential cellular mRNA targets of tRF5-GluCTC.\n",
      "One of the candidate mRNAs was shown to be a direct target of tRF5-GluCTC.\n",
      "Mechanistically, tRF5-GluCTC recognizes a target site in the 3'-untranslated region of APOER2 mRNA and suppresses its expression by an unknown mechanism.\n",
      "Further analysis identified a previously unappreciated role for APOER2 protein in antiviral defense against RSV infection [61].\n",
      "Thus, we have illuminated the roles of tRFs in host–virus interactions and described a novel molecular mechanism for host response regulation via gene targeting at posttranscriptional level, proving a potential therapeutic target to control RSV replication by regulating tRFs induction.\n",
      "As another example of tRFs with a positive effect on viral replication, a tRF-3 derived from tRNAPro (tRF-3019) has been suggested to function as a primer for reverse transcription of human T-cell leukemia virus-1 [62].\n",
      "The induction of tRFs is virus specific, as human metapneumovirus, a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family [63] and frequent cause for lower respiratory tract infections in young children, immunocompromised patients and older adults [64656667], did not induce tRFs but gradually enhanced the expression percentage of miRNAs in a time-dependent fashion [6].\n",
      "The involvement of tRFs in infectious diseases suggests that tRFs may be targets for the development of new drugs to control viral replication.\n",
      "The human genome encodes hundreds of tRNA genes and pseudogenes.\n",
      "In the past two decades, an increasing number of reports have revealed abundant expression of functional tRFs; thus, it now appears highly plausible that cells use tRNAs as a source for functional sncRNAs to modulate biological processes beyond its translation function.\n",
      "It is imperative to discriminate functional tRNA fragments from \"meaningless\" degradation products, and to biochemically elucidate the factors in their biogenesis as well as to determine their molecular functions.\n",
      "Although tRFs, at least the tRF-5s induced by RSV, regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional stages in the cytoplasm, the precise mechanism is yet to be clarified.\n",
      "Like miRNAs, tRFs can repress target mRNAs by inhibiting their translation or facilitating their decay.\n",
      "These questions can be answered by analyzing their localization, identifying their interacting protein partners besides Argonaute proteins, and examining various biological phenomena in response to the changes in the expression of tRFs.\n",
      "Bioinformatics studies with the support from biochemical assays have identified numerous novel tRNA-interacting proteins [68], implying that the biological functions of tRNAs and their fragments may be way beyond our expectations.\n",
      "Further combination of computational and biochemical efforts will significantly advance our understanding of functional tRFs and expand our knowledge regarding the tRNA world.\n",
      "The availability of genome sequencing data from patients with diverse conditions has already led to the identification of several mutations in tRNA genes and in genes involved in tRNA biogenesis [69].\n",
      "The task now is to ascertain whether these mutations indeed affect the repertoire of tRFs and consequently the molecular pathology of the diseases.\n",
      "Studies on tRFs are still at a very early stage.\n",
      "Additional functions for tRFs are likely to be discovered continuously.\n",
      "Improved understanding of the functions of tRFs will provide valuable insights into human physiology and pathophysiology.\n",
      "Recognition of tRFs as an important class of functional molecules has not happened until recently.\n",
      "The apparent presence of abundant tRFs in early studies with next generation sequencing data was often ignored.\n",
      "However, the combined biochemical evidence from many years of tRNA biology studies has brought the field to a previously unexpected conceptual consensus: specific tRFs are not simply random degradation products but functional molecules based on the following observations: (1) in many cases, tRFs do not derive from abundant cellular tRNAs, and the numbers of tRFs do not correlate with the parental tRNA gene copy numbers; (2) their fragmentation patterns are tRNA structure-dependent; (3) the fragmentation patterns is determined by the developmental stage or cell conditions; and (4) it is reported that some tRFs are bound to Argonaute/Piwi proteins, well-known components of the RNA-induced silencing complex [213170717273].\n",
      "The expression of tRFs does not usually affect mature tRNA pools.\n",
      "Instead, it is involved in normal biological processes beyond translation and in diseases; thus, studies of tRFs have provided new insights into tRNA biology.\n",

      "\n",
      "Neuropeptides produced from prohormones by selective action of endopeptidases are vital signaling molecules, playing a critical role in a variety of physiological processes, such as addiction, depression, pain, and circadian rhythms.\n",
      "Neuropeptides bind to post-synaptic receptors and elicit cellular effects like classical neurotransmitters.\n",
      "While each neuropeptide could have its own biological function, mass spectrometry (MS) allows for the identification of the precise molecular forms of each peptide without a priori knowledge of the peptide identity and for the quantitation of neuropeptides in different conditions of the samples.\n",
      "MS-based neuropeptidomics approaches have been applied to various animal models and conditions to characterize and quantify novel neuropeptides, as well as known neuropeptides, advancing our understanding of nervous system function over the past decade.\n",
      "Here, we will present an overview of neuropeptides and MS-based neuropeptidomic strategies for the identification and quantitation of neuropeptides.\n",
      "Neuropeptides, which signal between neurons, are known to be involved in a variety of physiological processes, including addiction, depression, hunger, pain, fear, anxiety, and circadian rhythms [12].\n",
      "Neuropeptides are 3–100 amino acid residues long and up to 50 times larger than classic neurotransmitters [3].\n",
      "The term \"neuropeptides\" was first introduced by De Wied [4] in 1971 to describe an endogenous peptide synthesized in nerve cells.\n",
      "While peptide hormones are also considered important intercellular signaling molecules, there are differences between neuropeptides and peptide hormones.\n",
      "That is, neuropeptides are secreted from neuronal cells (primarily neurons but also glia for some peptides) and signal to neighboring cells (primarily neurons), whereas peptide hormones are secreted from neuroendocrine cells and act on distant tissues by traveling through the blood [25].\n",
      "Approximately 100 different neuropeptides are currently known to function in cell-to-cell signaling (http://www.neuropeptides.nl).\n",
      "Neuropeptides bind to post-synaptic receptors and elicit cellular responses like classical neurotransmitters.\n",
      "Neuropeptides are produced from precursor proteins (or prohormones) by a series of enzymatic processing steps.\n",
      "The neuropeptide precursors generally do not have functions on their own, requiring processing to generate the active forms.\n",
      "The precursors are synthesized on ribosomes at the endoplasmic reticulum and processed through the Golgi [5].\n",
      "When the NH2-terminal signal peptide of the neuropeptide precursors is cleaved by signal peptidase, the precursors are routed to the Golgi apparatus and packaged into dense-core secretory vesicles together with processing proteases, termed convertases.\n",
      "Most neuropeptide precursors are first processed by endopeptidases, including prohormone convertase 1 (also known as prohormone convertase 3) and prohormone convertase 2 and, to a lesser extent, prohormone/proprotein convertase 5A (also known as prohormone/proprotein convertase 6A) [6].\n",
      "The endopeptidases typically cleave at pairs of basic amino acids, usually Lys-Arg (KR) or Arg-Arg (RR) sites, but on occasion, the basic amino acids are separated by 2, 4, or 6 other amino acids (Fig.1).\n",
      "The next stage of processing is the removal of C-terminal basic residues in the mature secretory vesicle.\n",
      "Carboxypeptidase E is the exopeptidase primarily responsible for removing the C-terminal basic residues, and carboxypeptidase D has also been shown to act in this role.\n",
      "After removal of the C-terminal basic residues, other enzymes perform additional post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as amidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, and glycosylation [6].\n",
      "For example, peptides with a C-terminal glycine are typically converted to the amide by peptidyl-α-amidating monooxygnenase [7], and tyrosine sulfation is known to be mediated by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase [8].\n",
      "These final bioactive forms of the peptides are stored within secretory vesicles that are accumulated within the cells.\n",
      "When the cells are stimulated, the secretory vesicles are known to fuse with the cellular membrane to release the neuropeptides into the extracellular environment [2].\n",
      "The secreted neuropeptides can interact with receptors containing specific binding sites.\n",
      "The receptors are often G-protein-coupled receptors.\n",
      "The interaction of the neuropeptides with the receptors causes a conformational change in the receptor, resulting in the production of a cellular response through a variety of mechanisms, depending on the type of receptor.\n",
      "While a single neuropeptide precursor often produces multiple neuropeptides, the proteolytic processing of the precursor protein occurs in a tissue-specific and even region-specific manner.\n",
      "A classic example is the processing of the precursor proopiomelanocortin in the pituitary.\n",
      "In the anterior lobe of the pituitary, the precursor is converted into adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which binds to several subtypes of melanocortin receptors, such as MC2R, located in the adrenal gland; this receptor controls the production of glucocorticoids (cortisol) [910].\n",
      "In the intermediate lobe of the pituitary and also in the brain, ACTH is further processed into alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which binds to melanocortin receptors with completely different affinities [11].\n",
      "The PTMs can also regulate the bioactivity and stability of the neuropeptides and therefore affect the binding affinities of the neuropeptides for the receptors.\n",
      "For example, acetylation of the N-terminus of β-endorphin removes the ability of the peptide to stimulate opioid receptors and to produce analgesia [6].\n",
      "Conversely, octanoylation of the peptide ghrelin on a serine residue is essential for the binding of the peptide to its receptor [12].\n",
      "Although the various aspects of peptide synthesis, including PTMs, lead to an increase in neuropeptide complexity, unveiling new peptides and unreported peptide properties is critical to advancing our understanding of nervous system function.\n",
      "While neuropeptides are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including hunger, food intake, body weight regulation, and circadian rhythms, it has been shown that dysregulation of neuropeptides often results in a variety of neurological disorders [131415].\n",
      "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures.\n",
      "Neuropeptides, such as arginine-vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), enkephalin, β-endorphin, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and tachykinins, were shown to have proconvulsive effects, whereas other neuropeptides, like ACTH, angiotensin, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, were able to suppress seizures in the brain [16].\n",
      "In addition, neuropeptides, such as dynorphin and substance P, were shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease with motor and non-motor symptoms [17].\n",
      "Progression to addiction is also known to be influenced by several peptidergic neuromodulators.\n",
      "A few orexigenic neuropeptides, including galanin, enkephalin, and orexin/hypocretin, were shown to have a positive feedback relationship to alcohol, while other hypothalamic neuropeptides, such as dynorphin, CRF, and melanocortins, showed a negative feedback relationship to alcohol intake.\n",
      "Dysregulation of these multiple neuropeptides is assumed to result in alcohol addiction [18].\n",
      "There was also a report that neuropeptides, such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide/PACAP, and neuropeptide Y (NPY), are associated with regulation of cutaneous immune responses and tissue maintenance and repair.\n",
      "Due to these diverse functions of neuropeptides, neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors have been drug targets for the treatment of neurological disorders [319].\n",
      "Title: Traditional methods of neuropeptide analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, the analysis of neuropeptides was performed by Edman sequencing, in which the N-terminal amino acid is sequentially removed.\n",
      "The method was developed by Edman in 1950 and is used for neuropeptide sequencing in many different species—for example, NPY in the porcine brain [20] and gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the dogfish brain [21].\n",
      "However, analysis by this method is slow and does not allow for the sequencing of neuropeptides containing N-terminal PTMs [22].\n",
      "Immunological techniques, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), have been used for measuring relative neuropeptide levels and spatial localization.\n",
      "RIA has been a popular tool to quantify neuropeptides in biological samples, such as NPY [23] and galanin in the rat brain [24].\n",
      "Although RIA is a relatively sensitive technique capable of absolute quantification of peptide levels, it is not always specific for a single-peptide form because of its antibody-based detection method.\n",
      "In addition, unless specific antibodies are available for the different isoforms, RIAs do not distinguish between these modifications.\n",
      "IHC has provided essential information regarding the localization of neuropeptides within the complexity of the brain structure, improving our understanding of the distribution of peptides.\n",
      "However, IHC does not report the actual size or full identity of the peptide, including PTMs.\n",
      "In addition, these antibody-based methods require a priori knowledge of a potential neuropeptide in order to generate antibodies specific to the neuropeptides and only detect peptide sequences with known structures.\n",
      "Title: Mass Spectrometry-Based Peptidomics\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to immuno-based methods, mass spectrometry (MS) enables one to detect and identify the precise forms of neuropeptides without a priori knowledge of the peptide's identity, resulting in the identification of previously unknown neuropeptides.\n",
      "MS has been used to identify and characterize hundreds of endogenous peptides in various animals [2526272829].\n",
      "The high-throughput discovery of neuropeptides based on MS has made up the field of peptidomics (Fig.2) [630313233].\n",
      "While typical proteomic analysis involves the digestion of proteins using proteases, such as trypsin, to generate peptides that can be readily sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), peptidomics focuses on the analysis of the native peptide forms, including PTMs, without using digestive enzymes.\n",
      "Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize as many neuropeptides as possible, because each peptide can have its own biological function.\n",
      "While MS-based peptidomics can be utilized to characterize a large number of neuropeptides simultaneously, it can be also applied to the quantification of individual neuropeptides.\n",
      "Title: Sample Preparation for Peptidomics Experiment\n",
      "\n",
      "Although MS allows the identification of a large number of neuropeptides in a high-throughput manner, sample preparation prior to MS is a critical step that affects peptide identification coverage in peptidomics experiments.\n",
      "When the animal is sacrificed and the brain tissue of interest is obtained, proteases rapidly degrade larger proteins into smaller peptides that fall into the mass range of neuropeptides.\n",
      "The presence of degraded products derived from highly abundant proteins often complicates the MS analysis and interferes with the identification of less abundant neuropeptides.\n",
      "Different techniques, including focused microwave irradiation before decapitation, microwave irradiation after decapitation, and boiling the tissue immediately after decapitation, have been used in order to inactivate the proteases responsible for the high background of protein degradation fragments [323435363738].\n",
      "In addition to the procedures of protease deactivation, peptide extraction and subsequent treatment are other steps that affect the number of identified neuropeptides.\n",
      "The use of different solvents and procedures can affect the peptide profiles detectable in brain tissue.\n",
      "Che et al.\n",
      "[31] compared different extraction conditions for the recovery of neuropeptides from mouse hypothalamus.\n",
      "They found that sonication and heating in water (70℃ for 20 min), followed by cold acid and centrifugation, enabled the efficient extraction of many neuropeptides without the formation of the protein degradation fragments seen with hot acid extractions.\n",
      "Bora et al.\n",
      "[39] and Lee et al.\n",
      "[37] also showed that multiple stages of peptide extraction, including boiling water, acidified acetone, and acetic acid, were able to maximize the number of identified neuropeptides from their respective analyses of supraoptic nucleus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) samples in the rat brain.\n",
      "Title: MS Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "After sample processing, the extracted peptides are subjected to MS analysis.\n",
      "A mass spectrometer consists of an ionization source, a mass analyzer separating the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and a detector recording the number of ions at each m/z value.\n",
      "Two commonly used types of ionization are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).\n",
      "While each approach has its own advantages, MALDI is more tolerant to the presence of salts.\n",
      "Thus, MALDI is often applied to direct tissue profiling or molecular ion imaging from tissue sections.\n",
      "Direct tissue sample analysis by MALDI-based MS is usually performed by a simple sequence of steps, which include placing the tissue of interest on the MALDI plate, applying a droplet of matrix, and irradiating the co-crystallized tissue to cause desorption/ionization of the peptides [30].\n",
      "MALDI imaging provides valuable information pertaining to the spatial localization of neuropeptides [40].\n",
      "Although MALDI-MS can be interfaced with separation strategies, such as liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis, ESI-MS can be coupled more easily with the separation methods, because the ions are produced as an aerosol from the liquid phase with a high voltage in ESI.\n",
      "The introduction of a nano-electrospray, based on capillary LC, coupled to MS, significantly increases the sensitivity in LC-ESI-MS, and furthermore, the preferred formation of multiple-charge states in ESI allows for more comprehensive MS/MS fragmentation data.\n",
      "Title: MS Data Analysis for Neuropeptide Identification\n",
      "\n",
      "While neuropeptides can be identified by comparing experimental peptide masses obtained from MS data against a list of known neuropeptide masses, they are typically identified with both MS and MS/MS fragmentation data.\n",
      "While collision-induced dissociation is widely used for peptide identification, other fragmentation methods, such as higher energy collision dissociation and electron transfer dissociation, have recently improved the identification capability of peptides and PTM localization [414243].\n",
      "The automated identification of neuropeptides based on their MS and MS/MS data is pursued by using proteomic-based search engines, such as Mascot, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, Peaks Studio, and ProSightPC [3744454647].\n",
      "Since peptidomics searches typically employ criteria, such as no enzymatic cleavage and various common modifications (e.g., N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation), they often require a larger search space and longer search times for peptide identification.\n",
      "Several neuropeptide prohormone databases, including SwePep, have been constructed to facilitate neuropeptide identification, and cleavage prediction programs, such as NeuroPred, were developed to predict cleavage sites in prohormones and to provide the masses of the resulting peptides [4849].\n",
      "In addition to the database search strategies, neuropeptides can be also identified by de novo sequencing, especially when the species of interest does not have a sequenced genome.\n",
      "While peptide spectra are compared with theoretical peptides in the database search strategy, de novo sequencing, which is the direct assignment of the amino acid sequence from the MS/MS spectrum, can be pursued when the database is not available.\n",
      "Although de novo sequencing can be performed manually, the process is labor-intensive and time-consuming.\n",
      "There are several software packages that can perform de novo sequencing directly on MS/MS data, including Lutefisk (http://www.hairyfatguy.com/lutefisk/), Mascot Distiller (Matrix Science), and PEAKS (Bioinformatics Solutions, http://www.bioinformaticssolutions.com/) [30].\n",
      "The peptide sequences obtained from de novo sequencing are often compared with the nonredundant database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information to establish the peptide identities with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).\n",

      "\n",
      "MS-based peptidomic techniques allow for measuring relative levels of peptides in different conditions of the samples, as well as peptide identification.\n",
      "Quantitation of peptides based on MS is generally achieved either by stable isotope labeling or label-free approaches (Fig.3) [5051].\n",
      "In stable isotope labeling, the relative levels of peptides in two different samples are typically examined by labeling the peptides in one sample with a light stable isotope and those in the other sample with a heavy stable isotope; the two samples are then combined and analyzed together.\n",
      "The relative levels of the peptides are calculated by the difference in the MS peaks (peak intensity or peak area) of the two samples.\n",
      "While the stable isotopes can be introduced to the peptides either metabolically or through chemical reactions, isotope labeling through chemical reactions enables one to obtain quantitative information from biological samples, such as brain tissues, for which metabolic labeling is not available.\n",
      "A number of different isotopic tags, including acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and trimethylammonium butyrate (TMAB), have been used for quantitative analyses of endogenous peptides in various samples and conditions [63452].\n",
      "For example, the TMAB tag was used to evaluate the relative changes of endogenous peptides in response to food intake or drug treatment [535455] and to assess the role of protein convertase 1/3 and 2 in the processing of the peptides in mouse models [5657].\n",
      "In label-free methods, each sample is prepared separately and then subjected directly to individual LC-MS or LC-MS/MS runs, followed by comparisons of either the mass spectral peak intensities of the detected peptides or the total number of MS/MS spectra identified for a peptide, called spectral counting [51].\n",
      "Since there is no limit to the number of samples that can be compared, label-free quantitation allows for the comparison of multiple samples or conditions.\n",
      "The approach has been used to measure the changes in the levels of neuropeptides present during the daytime and nighttime in the rat SCN [5859] and to examine the expression changes of endogenous peptides involved in the embryogenesis of Japanese quail brains [60] and the nucleus accumbens of morphine-dependent rats [61].\n",
      "In addition, quantitative peptidomic analyses based on peak intensities has enabled us to discover endogenous peptides associated with repeated exposure to amphetamine and with individual variations in sensitivity to the behavioral effects of cocaine in rat models [6263].\n",
      "Neuropeptides are important signaling molecules that are involved in many kinds of physiological processes, including addiction, depression, mood regulation, and circadian rhythms.\n",
      "Because of their biological significance, neuropeptides have become key targets in drug discovery.\n",

      "Recent advances in high-resolution peptide separation, comprehensive fractionation, and high performance MS considerably improved the proteome size and depth (increased numbers of proteins and PTM sites measured) and also the accuracy in quantitative information of proteomic data (abundances of proteins and PTM sites) [5].\n",
      "Moreover, MS-based proteome analysis required large amounts of samples to measure reliably proteins and PTM sites.\n",
      "To resolve this problem, the methods for serial enrichments of different PTMs from the same sample have been developed to significantly reduce the sample amount required [6].\n",
      "These advanced MS-based proteomic technologies have facilitated the generation of proteome and PTM profiles in tissue and body fluid (plasma/serum, urine, ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, saliva, and tear) samples collected from the patients with a broad spectrum of human diseases.\n",

      "Next, for the initial candidates whose disease-related alterations in their abundances were confirmed in the small cohort during the verification phase, their validity as biomarkers is tested in a large cohort of the patients (validation phase) [5].\n",

      "For each measured MS/MS spectrum, the peptide with the largest score value is then selected, which defines a peptide-spectrum match (PSM).\n",
      "Next, the statistical significance of the PSMs resulted from the database search is evaluated using a statistical method, such as PeptideProphet [22] in the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline [23] or the target-decoy method (Table 1) [24].\n",
      "For example, for each PSM, PeptideProphet combines the scores (X-corr, deltaCorr, SPrank, and SP value) to an F score, and a mixture of Gaussian and Gamma distributions is fitted to the distribution of F scores for all PSMs.\n",
      "Using the mixture distribution, the probability of a PSM being true (PeptideProphet p-value) is estimated [25].\n",
      "Finally, the PSMs with PeptideProphet p-value > 0.95 are selected as the correct PSMs.\n",
      "In the target-decoy method, a reverse sequence database was generated by inversing the reference protein sequence in the database and then included in the database prior to the database search.\n",
      "Using the score values for the PSMs in which the peptide sequence was obtained from the reverse sequence database, false discovery rates (FDRs) for all PSMs are estimated [24].\n",
      "Finally, the PSMs with FDR < 0.01 are selected as the correct PSMs.\n",
      "Recent studies have shown that the best coverage of the detected proteome can be obtained by combining the outputs from multiple search engines.\n",
      "For example, Compid enables the integration of Paragon and Mascot (Table 1) [24] by assigning the peptides with higher scores from the two search engines to the MS/MS spectra, which can leads to unreliable false positive rates.\n",
      "Also, MSblender integrates the search scores from the search engines into a probability score for every possible PSM and then estimates FDRs for the PSMs in a reliable manner [26].\n",
      "This method identifies more PSMs than any single search engine at the same FDR.\n",
      "After identifying all the PSMs from the database search, a list of the detected proteins are further identified.\n",
      "Using the SEQUEST search outputs, the probability that a protein is correctly identified (ProteinProphet p-value) is calculated by statistically combining the PeptideProphet p-values of the peptides derived from the protein, and the proteins with PeptideProphet p-value > 0.99 are selected as the proteins correctly identified [22].\n",
      "In the target decoy method, the proteins with more than two non-redundant peptides with FDR < 0.01 can be considered as the reliable proteins [27].\n",
      "Title: Protein quantitation\n",
      "\n",
      "Several LC-MS/MS approaches provide quantitative information of the peptides identified from the database search (protein quantification) (Fig.1).\n",
      "First, prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides can be labeled using the isotopic agents, such as isotope-coded affinity tag (iCAT) [28], isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) [29], or tandem mass tags (TMT) [30].\n",
      "For the iCAT data, the abundance of an identified peptide is estimated as the area under the elusion curve of the peptide.\n",
      "On the other hand, for the iTRAQ or TMT data, the peptide abundance is estimated as the intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS data [31].\n",
      "Second, when no isotope labeling was done, called label-free LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptide abundance is estimated as the area under the elusion curve of the peptide as done for the iCAT data.\n",
      "Next, the relative abundance of an identified peptide is calculated as the ratio of the peptide abundances between patient and control samples.\n",
      "From the iCAT data, the ratios of the heavy and light peptides are calculated as the relative peptide abundance.\n",
      "To estimate the relative abundances of a protein, a list of the peptides derived from the proteins are identified and the relative abundances of these peptides are then combined using a method for protein quantitation, such as the quantification tool in MaxQuant software [32] or a linear programming method [33].\n",
      "Title: Identification of differentially expressed proteins\n",
      "\n",
      "The biomarkers should reflect the alteration of disease-related pathophysiological processes in the patient samples, compared to controls.\n",
      "Thus, the DEPs between control and patient samples are identified as the biomarker candidates (identification of DEPs) (Fig.1).\n",
      "A number of statistical methods have been developed for identification of the DEPs, such as t-test [34] or integrative statistical methods [3536], with the multiple comparison correction.\n",
      "These methods compare the relative protein abundances between control and patient samples and then estimate the significance (p-value or FDR) of the difference in the relative protein abundances between control and patient samples methods.\n",
      "The proteins with p-value or FDR < 0.01 or 0.05 are then selected as the DEPs.\n",
      "Furthermore, additional constraints are used to select more reliable DEPs.\n",
      "For example, for each DEP, the number of the patients showing the fold-changes larger than a cutoff (1.5- or 2-fold) is counted, and a subset of DEPs with the number of patients larger than a certain percentage (50% of the patients) can be selected as the reliable DEPs [37].\n",
      "Using this criterion, we can focus on the DEPs that are likely to show their alterations in the abundance in at least more than half of the patients when they were used as biomarker candidates for newly collected patient samples.\n",
      "Title: Functional enrichment analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The alterations in protein abundances under disease conditions reflect simple clinical symptoms that are commonly observed in many other diseases, such as inflammation or immune responses, or the alterations of the pathophysiological processes specific to the target disease, such as aggregation of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Thus, the DEPs that are involved in the disease-related pathophysiological processes can represent more effectively the alterations specific to the target disease (Fig.2).\n",
      "To effectively understand the pathophysiological processes altered under disease conditions, functional enrichment analysis is often performed for the DEPs using diverse enrichment tools.\n",
      "For example, the enrichment analysis of gene ontology biological processes (GOBPs) or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways can be applied to the DEPs using DAVID [38] and PANTHER [39], and commercial tools, such as MetaCore [40] and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) (Table 1).\n",
      "A list of GOBPs or KEGG pathways with enrichment p-value < 0.05 are selected as the pathophysiological processes or cellular pathways altered under disease conditions.\n",
      "Of these selected GOBPs and KEGG pathways, a subset of the GOBPs related to the target disease is further selected based on the knowledge of the target disease.\n",
      "Finally, a subset of the DEPs that are involved in the selected GOBPs or KEGG pathways related to the target disease can be selected as an initial set of biomarker candidates, considering that these DEPs are likely to be specifically associated with the target disease.\n",
      "No enrichment analysis mentioned above consider quantitatively the differences in fold-changes of the DEPs, but consider equivalently the DEPs that were selected using a fixed cutoff (p-value and/or fold-changes).\n",
      "To remedy this problem, several functional class scoring methods have been developed, such as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Table 1, Fig.2) [41].\n",
      "In the GSEA, all D-changes, and the enrichment of functional modules defined in the database, such as the molecular signatures database (MSigDB) (Table 1), by the top or bottom of the ranked protein list is statistically evaluated.\n",
      "Several alternative module-level statistics to the conventional GSEA have been also used, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the maxmean statistic [42].\n",
      "Moreover, as an alternative enrichment analysis, several pathway topology approaches have been developed, such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) [43] and network perturbation amplitude (NPA) (Table 1, Fig.2) [26].\n",
      "These approaches consider whether the proteins involved in functional modules defined by GOBP or GSEA database (MSigDB) interact with each other in cellular networks.\n",
      "In the SPIA, a conventional overrepresentation measure, as in GOBP enrichment analysis and a topology measure of the pathway are combined to identify functional modules in which the DEPs are significantly connected.\n",
      "In the NPA, the upper and lower tiers are defined as cellular pathways (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation) and target genes/proteins regulated by the pathways in the upper tier, respectively, and positive and negative causal relationships are defined by the links between the upper and lower tiers.\n",
      "Then, NPA evaluates the causal relationships by quantitatively summarizing whether the expression changes of the downstream nodes are consistent with pathway activation, inactivation, or no change.\n",
      "These analyses provide a list of functional modules significantly altered under disease conditions.\n",
      "Similar to the case of the GOBP enrichment analysis, a subset of function modules related to the target disease can be identified, and a subset of DEPs involved in the identified functional modules can be selected as an initial set of biomarker candidates.\n",
      "Title: Network modeling and analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Functional molecules or cellular networks altered under disease conditions interact closely with each other to form a disease-perturbed cellular network.\n",
      "The network model enables identification of hub-like molecules that can serve as core indicators of the activities of cellular processes described in the network model.\n",
      "Thus, it is important to understand the disease-perturbed cellular network to identify the core indicators as the biomarker candidates.\n",
      "The core molecules and their associated cellular pathways have been further suggested as therapeutic targets or the biomarker candidates that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments (e.g., drug efficacy) for the target disease.\n",
      "Hence, the network-based approaches have been employed for protein biomarker discovery.\n",
      "The network-based approaches first reconstruct a disease-perturbed cellular network model describing the interactions of the DEPs or a subset of the DEPs involved in the selected GOBPs related to the target disease using protein-protein (PPIs), protein-DNA (PDIs), and/or protein-metabolite interactions (PMIs) in the following interactome databases (Table 1, Fig.2): (1) PPI databases: human protein reference database (HPRD) [44], biological general repository for interaction datasets (BioGRID) [45], biomolecular interaction network database (BIND) [46], search tool for recurring instances of neighbouring genes (STRING) [47], and Molecular INTeraction database (MINT) [48]; (2) PDI databases: EdgeExpressDB (FANTOM4-EEDB) [49], transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) [50], MSigDB [41], MultiNet [51], and MetaCore [40]; and (3) PMI database: KEGG pathway database [52].\n",
      "Next, the network model are analyzed to identify network modules or clusters each of which includes a set of the nodes densely connected in the network (Fig.2).\n",
      "For network clustering or modularization, a number of methods, such as jActiveModules [53], ResponseNet [54], NetWalker [55], and clusterMaker [56], have been developed (Table 1).\n",
      "These methods can be categorized into two groups.\n",
      "One group, such as clusterMaker, searches for the node clusters based on the network topology information such that the nodes in the same cluster have dense connections, but sparse connections between the different clusters [56].\n",
      "The other group, such as jActiveModules, uses the quantitative fold-changes of the nodes between control and patient samples measured by LC-MS/MS together with the network topology information.\n",
      "In this group, the node clusters are identified such that the nodes in the same clusters are densely connected and also show similar alteration patterns in protein abundance [53].\n",
      "For functional interpretation of the node clusters resulted from network clustering, functional enrichment analyses mentioned above are then performed for the nodes in each network cluster.\n",
      "Of the node clusters, prior to the enrichment analysis, we can focus on the major network clusters including large numbers of the DEPs.\n",
      "The functional enrichment analysis then provide a subset of the major network clusters whose functions (e.g., GOBPs or KEGG pathways) are associated with the disease-related cellular processes.\n",
      "This subset can be considered as potential determinants of the disease-perturbed cellular network.\n",
      "Finally, the hub-like DEP in each major network cluster is selected as a biomarker candidate that can reflect the perturbation of the disease-related cellular process associated with the network cluster.\n",
      "Mitra et al.\n",
      "[57] demonstrated the power of the network-based biomarker discovery approach in prediction of metastatic cancers in human breast cancer.\n",
      "They identified network clusters with dysregulated expression using SigArSearch and showed that the network clusters were more accurate in distinguishing metastatic cancers from non-metastatic cancers, compared with individual cancer-gene markers.\n",
      "Title: Integrative analysis of proteomic data with other global data\n",
      "\n",
      "Other global data than proteomic data, such as mRNA expression, mutation, DNA methylation, histone modification, can provide complementary information that enables to select reliable biomarker candidates when they are integrated with the proteomic data.\n",
      "The integrative analysis of proteomic data with other types of global datasets can be categorized into two groups (Fig.3): (1) the molecular level and (2) the network-level integration methods [58].\n",
      "The proteome data are contaminated with the noises coming from numerous sources of technical variability during LC-MS/MS experiments and biological variability in patient samples during sample collection and preparation [5960].\n",
      "The integration of disparate global datasets reduces the artifacts of the noises in selection of the DEPs by enabling us to focus on the reliable DEPs showing consistent changes between control and patient samples in multiple types of global data [58].\n",
      "In the molecular level integration method, the DEPs that show consistent alterations in the other global datasets (e.g., mRNA expression data) are searched, assuming that they are more reliable indicators of the perturbation of cellular processes under disease conditions (Fig.3).\n",
      "Biomarker candidates can be then selected from these reliable DEPs.\n",
      "For example, the DEPs selected from the tissue data can be supported by the consistency in the altered expression of their corresponding mRNAs.\n",
      "Also, the DEPs can be further supported by the consistency in the changes of copy number variations or DNA and/or histone methylations of the corresponding genes.\n",
      "Moreover, the reliability of the DEPs selected from the serum proteome data can be supported by the altered expression of their corresponding mRNAs or proteins in the tissues from the target organ.\n",
      "Hyung et al.\n",
      "[61] demonstrated the value of the integrative analysis of serum proteome data with mRNA expression and proteome data obtained from the tissues in human breast cancers.\n",
      "They selected the DEPs between the serum samples collected from sensitive and resistant patients to a combinatorial chemotherapy using doxorubicin and docetaxol and then further selected the DEPs with altered expression of the corresponding mRNAs and proteins in the breast tissue samples.\n",
      "During the validation of biomarker candidates, they showed that the DEPs with the consistent alteration in the tissues showed higher accuracy in their validation using western blotting for a validation cohort of independent serum samples.\n",
      "Individual patients can show the variation in altered molecules of a cellular pathway though the same pathway is consistently perturbed under disease conditions.\n",
      "Given the variation, these molecules cannot be selected as DEPs using the conventional statistical methods, thereby leading to the failure to identify biomarkers that reflect the alteration of such cellular pathways.\n",
      "Thus, it has been addressed that cellular pathways can serve as a more reliable indicator of the altered cellular processes under disease conditions, compared to individual molecules [58].\n",
      "Different types of molecules (mRNA/proteins, microRNAs, DNA methylations, and metabolites) can represent distinct layers of cellular networks.\n",
      "Thus, a cellular network can be modeled in a multi-layered network where each layer can be delineated by a distinct type of the molecules.\n",
      "For example, transcriptional and microRNA regulatory networks are defined by interactions of transcription factors and microRNAs, respectively, with their target mRNAs.\n",
      "Also, cellular signaling networks are defined by protein-protein interactions (kinase-substrate interactions), while DNA methylation networks are defined by interactions of methyltransferases and demethylases with their target DNAs and mRNAs.\n",
      "The integration of multiple global datasets for different types of molecules enables us to decode the multi-layered cellular networks associated with the target disease.\n",
      "A number of the tools have been developed to understand the subnetworks (network clusters) of the multi-layered networks whose perturbations are collectively indicated by different types of global datasets, including IPA (QIAGEN Redwood City, http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity), HotNet [62], or SteinerNet (Table 1) [63].\n",
      "Although these tools can be applied for integration of proteomic data with other types of global data, they have been used mainly for integration of disparate genomic and transcriptomic data.\n",
      "Recently, Shi et al.\n",
      "[64] developed NetGestalt that can be used for integration of multi-dimensional global datasets including proteomic data.\n",
      "For example, using NegGestalt, Zhu et al.\n",
      "[65] identified KRAS and AKAP12 subnetworks that can play important roles in pathogenesis of colorectal cancers by integrating proteomic data with mutation, copy number variation, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression data generated from colon tissues and cells.\n",
      "Finally, the hub-like molecules in the subnetworks are selected as key indicators of the alterations of the disease-related processes associated with the subnetworks.\n",
      "For example, Iliopoulos et al.\n",
      "[66] identified a set of the biomarker candidates by performing the network-based integration of the proteome and microRNA expression data.\n",
      "Also, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network identified the notch signaling pathway as a key molecule representing the pathogenesis of ovarian cancers by integrating somatic mutation, copy number variation, and mRNA expression data using HotNet analysis [67].\n",
      "In this review, we summarized a battery of bioinformatics analyses for network-based biomarker discovery using LC-MS/MS data.\n",
      "These analyses include peptide/protein identification using database search engines, peptide/protein quantification from MS or MS/MS data, identification of DEPs using statistical methods, functional enrichment analysis of DEPs using diverse enrichment tools, and network modeling and analysis of DEPs, as well as integrative analysis of disparate global datasets with the LC-MS/MS data.\n",
      "Peptide identification using database search has been known as a main challenge.\n",
      "Of the MS/MS spectra measured, about half of them are commonly mapped to peptide sequences.\n",
      "The inclusion of PTMs in database search can map the unidentified MS/MS spectra to peptide sequences.\n",
      "However, the PTM inclusion exponentially increases the search time and thus it would be practically impossible to include the most common five PTMs, phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and acetylation in database search.\n",
      "Recently, although several search tools, such as MODa [68], with improved search speeds have been developed, there is still significant needs for efficient search tools that can include the five common PTMs in the search.\n",
      "Moreover, protein quantification has been also one of the challenges in MS-based proteomic analysis.\n",
      "Relative protein abundances are estimated by combining the ratios of abundances of the peptides derived from the protein.\n",
      "The same peptide sequences can be derived from multiple proteins due to the redundancy in their sequences, which can cause the discrepancy in the ratios of the peptides from the same protein between control and patient samples.\n",
      "Also, technical and biological variability can add the discrepancy to the peptide ratios.\n",
      "Because of these sources of the discrepancy in the peptide ratios, it has been difficult to estimate the relative ratios of protein abundances between control and patient samples.\n",
      "Recently, although the optimization-based quantification tools, such as linear programming [33], have been developed, there have been significant needs for the quantification methods with improved accuracy.\n",
      "Due to the issue with protein quantification, identification of DEPs can be also erroneous when inaccurate ratios of protein abundances exist.\n",
      "Additional criteria, such as the number of patients showing fold-changes larger than a cutoff (e.g., 1.5-fold), are used to reduce the error (false-positives) in identification of DEPs.\n",
      "The error in identification of DEPs can further propagate into functional enrichment analysis and network modeling and analysis for the DEPs.\n",
      "Finally, the integrative analysis of disparate global datasets suffers from different scales of fold-changes and the size of detected molecules in the different types of global datasets.\n",
      "For example, mRNA fold-changes between control and patient samples can be relatively larger than the fold-changes of protein abundances, which may cause the bias toward mRNA fold-changes during the integration of fold-changes of mRNA and protein abundances.\n",
      "Also, differentially expressed microRNAs between control and patient samples are smaller than the DEPs or mRNAs, which can lead to the bias toward the DEPs or mRNAs during the integration.\n",
      "Various integration strategies have been proposed to reduce the intrinsic bias from the differences in the size of disparate global datasets.\n",
      "For example, in these methods, mRNA and protein abundance ratios are first integrated and the data with small sizes are separately integrated to the outputs from the initial integration of mRNA and protein data.\n",
      "However, regarding the scale difference in fold-changes, there have been the needs for the algorithms that can effectively normalize the different scales of fold-changes in different datasets.\n",

      "Internet addiction (IA) has become a widespread and problematic phenomenon as smart devices pervade society.\n",
      "Moreover, internet gaming disorder leads to increases in social expenditures for both individuals and nations alike.\n",
      "Although the prevention and treatment of IA are getting more important, the diagnosis of IA remains problematic.\n",
      "Understanding the neurobiological mechanism of behavioral addictions is essential for the development of specific and effective treatments.\n",
      "Although there are many databases related to other addictions, a database for IA has not been developed yet.\n",
      "In addition, bioinformatics databases, especially genetic databases, require a high level of security and should be designed based on medical information standards.\n",
      "In this respect, our study proposes the OAuth standard protocol for database access authorization.\n",
      "The proposed IA Bioinformatics (IABio) database system is based on internet user authentication, which is a guideline for medical information standards, and uses OAuth 2.0 for access control technology.\n",
      "This study designed and developed the system requirements and configuration.\n",
      "The OAuth 2.0 protocol is expected to establish the security of personal medical information and be applied to genomic research on IA.\n",
      "Information technology has developed so rapidly all over the world that smart devices have become popularized and digital contents have been diversified.\n",
      "As a consequence, internet addiction (IA) has become an important issue.\n",
      "Although the prevention and treatment of IA are more important than ever due to pervasive digital media and although measures to establish a systematic research environment and overcome addiction problems are more necessary than ever, unfortunately, these steps not progressing fast enough.\n",
      "It has been known that IA leads to diverse psychosomatic problems, such as nonaggressive or oppositional behavior and hostility.\n",
      "In Korea, it was reported that 7% of internet users aged 5 to 54 years are at risk of IA, and the percentage keeps growing [1].\n",
      "IA disorder, which has many similarities to psychopathological disorders, is on the rise and is considered a potential problem.\n",
      "Therefore, a diagnostic standard is required considering DNA, protein, and the characteristics of the structure of the brain.\n",
      "Many studies have been conducted on genomes that affect addictions to substances, such as alcohol, and a considerable number of databases have been built up.\n",
      "However, a biological database of genes, proteins, and brain structures, which can be used directly for IA, is not sufficient.\n",
      "To build a genome database related to IA, personal genome data, which are sensitive to handle, have to be examined, so security should be guaranteed.\n",
      "In addition, a medical information standard-based environment is very important in terms of security.\n",
      "It requires a medical information standard and access control technology for the service environment of genomic database [23].\n",

      "It has been difficult to verify the connection between addiction and genes in the past, but some attempts have been made to identify the DNA responsible for addiction in the last decade.\n",
      "The findings say that when a genetic mutation occurs in a certain region of dopamine receptor in a human brain, dopamine receptor fails to function properly and thus can have superficial behavioral inclinations, such as addiction to smoking, alcohol, or drugs [8].\n",
      "According to those studies, when genetic mutation occurs in a certain region of dopamine receptor in a human brain, dopamine receptor fails to function properly, and when the mutated genes make contact with a substance, they secrete acetylcholine, which stimulates pleasure, which leads to addiction.\n",
      "The genes known to be related to addiction are DRD2 Tag 1A, DRD2 Tag 1B, and so on.\n",
      "A German psychobiologic research team examined and compared 132 internet addicts and 711 normal people to find the cause of addiction and found that most of the addicts had a mutated gene called CHRNA4NA4 [9].\n",
      "It is necessary that a database be built for addiction and that a service provision environment be established for studies regarding IA.\n",

      "IUA is an IHE profile based on access control with token-based authentication and provides access authority to medical information services and guidelines for user authentication.\n",
      "The IUA guideline is seen in Fig.1.\n",
      "It can grant only necessary authorities to other users according to database policy and can also provide other services in a single server, which means that it has an excellent scalability.\n",
      "In addition, when authorization is obtained from one authorization server, it allows the authority to use the information related to a certain user.\n",
      "For an authorization client to use the resource, it is necessary to obtain an authorization token from the authorization server.\n",
      "Authorization token holders need to check the terms of validity before using it.\n",
      "In case the term expires, they need to get new authorization tokens.\n",
      "A database environment is suitable for using other data, such as genes, proteins, and brain images, and can protect patients' data systematically.\n",
      "In this study, IUA is used to build a database applied with a medical information standard and OAuth 2.0 to be applied to standard IUA guidelines.\n",
      "OAuth 2.0 is a protocol with authorization function to control and manage access to web services.\n",
      "The HTTP RESTful method is used to perform access control using an authorization token and to ask an authorization server for resources [10].\n",
      "HTTP RESTful is a method to request services through a URL.\n",
      "Because it uses data messages in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is small in size, it is mainly used for mobile services at present [11].\n",
      "OAuth 2.0 uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to give and take authorization tokens and messages.\n",
      "There are four authorization methods.\n",
      "Because the authorization method differs by scenario, load in a server should be considered.\n",
      "It should support scalability for a large service.\n",
      "In addition, the service provider and authorization server are completely separate; so, server multiplexing and authorization server multiplexing are possible.\n",
      "There are four authorization methods: authorization code grant (ACG), implicit grant (IG), resource owner password credentials grant (ROPCG), and client credential grant (CCG).\n",
      "ACG and IG are re-direction methods and should interact with resource owners and receive requests.\n",
      "ROPCG is an authorization method in which a client receives a resource owner's authorization information directly and relays it to the authorization server.\n",
      "CCG can provide requests only with an authorization token.\n",
      "Complicated methods, such as ACG and IG, are not needed in a database environment for analysis, because the level of trust between users and providers is high.\n",
      "In addition, CCG can not be used, because resources have to be used.\n",
      "Therefore, ROPCG is the most appropriate method for IABio.\n",
      "The IABio platform service can be applied with medical information security guidelines; can provide a portal service; and can collect and analyze databases related to IA.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is necessary to analyze the complicated requirements of the system to design and develop the IABio platform service.\n",
      "Because security is very important to a medical information system, it requires user identification.\n",
      "In addition, the data exchange method, integrated data composition, and services should be specified.\n",
      "Title: User identification\n",
      "\n",
      "It is needed to analyze patients' genomic data concerning IA for treatment and prevention and to provide them with customized service.\n",
      "To do so, an integrated data analysis system is required and should work with all genomic information.\n",
      "Users with access to IABio are classified into gene researcher, protein researcher, brain imaging researcher, senior researcher for integrated work, and server manager.\n",
      "Each manager has access to a patient's genome information according to the Medical Care Act, but the researcher is limited to only 'concerned' information and can not have access to other information.\n",
      "However, all of the researchers can have access to the risk outcome that is yielded from the integrated analysis of all genomic information.\n",
      "The integrated analysis risk results do not include individual patient information but are considered new information and thus are not against the Medical Care Act.\n",
      "Therefore, each researcher can search, enter data, and modify genomic data he manages and can search out integrated analysis outcomes.\n",
      "Title: Standard-based biological data exchange\n",
      "\n",
      "To subdivide access from each researcher, access control is needed or else the server manager can not even read the genomic data.\n",
      "Therefore, a server manager can only control information that the genome manager has access to.\n",
      "To do so, the authorization server and IABio server have to be separated physically.\n",
      "Medical information standard-based guidelines and access control are necessary for authorization and approval.\n",
      "Title: Integrated biological data platform\n",
      "\n",
      "Biological data (gene, protein, and brain structure image) have different identifier values.\n",
      "However, if several pieces of genomic data for one patient have more than one identifier, it is against data integrity, because information for one patient is duplicated.\n",
      "In addition, because genome information entered by each data manager is created in different systems, an identification system is needed.\n",
      "Title: Web portal service\n",
      "\n",
      "Access to an integrated database requires an accessible service and web portal service in which the authorization and approval procedure has been established, which is necessary to search data related to a genome.\n",

      "IA risk factors should be provided through integrated analysis based on data entered by each researcher and user.\n",
      "Integrated information should be provided for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and protein markers related to IA.\n",
      "Also, the accuracy of risk factors should advance enough to utilize a diagnostic index.\n",
      "After risk factors that are highly relevant to IA are determined through the integrated analysis of several areas in the genome, a risk evaluation score for the respective factor should be provided.\n",
      "To compose such a sophisticated system, our study uses medical standard guidelines in designing the genome database platform.\n",
      "Title: IABio service architecture\n",

      "Aiming to provide a genome database platform for IA, our study designs the IABio platform service structure in consideration of medical standard security and requirements as shown in Fig.2.\n",
      "By relevance to the genome, the users are divided into gene researcher, protein researcher, brain imaging researcher, and senior researcher.\n",
      "Each user can operate and monitor accessible data by his/her authority.\n",
      "In addition, the users can connect to it through a smart device or web service.\n",
      "For users to have access to IABio, they should be issued authorization tokens from the authorization server.\n",
      "The authorization token functions to identify researchers using genome information and is physically separated from the IABio platform.\n",
      "When using such an authorization token, it is possible to access IABio.\n",
      "When an authorization token is not valid or when a user is not registered, the token should be issued or re-issued by the authorization server.\n",
      "Our study complies with IUA medical standard guidelines for access, uses OAuth 2.0, and composes the security system.\n",
      "IABio is accessible through a web portal.\n",
      "Genome data entered by each researcher are entered in a database in an agreeable format to master patient index (MPI) structure.\n",
      "Because gene, protein, and brain imaging data are all in different data formats, a method is necessary to integrate them.\n",
      "Therefore, MPI is used.\n",
      "It allows scalability in connection with different clinical data.\n",
      "MPI configures the data format in a way to identify them, develops them into a hash-type algorithm, creates an identification system, and maintains data integrity.\n",
      "In an MPI-based identification system, each manager does not know the password structure.\n",
      "Therefore, researchers can not have access to different data.\n",
      "The security system of the proposed IABio platform has pre-defined password keys with the authorization server and performs the authorization and approval procedure by the user.\n",
      "The contents of MPI are not described here, because they are not part of the aim of this study.\n",
      "Three analyses are performed to provide services from IABio.\n",
      "The first is proteomics analysis.\n",
      "Proteomics is a study concerned with the structure and analysis of proteins occurring in living organisms.\n",
      "It aims to analyze proteins on a great scale; write a map of functional interrelations; and demonstrate a certain protein and the gene that creates it through structural analysis.\n",
      "The second analysis is IA risk factor analysis.\n",
      "SNPs and protein markers related to IA yield risk factors for IA.\n",
      "In addition, it analyzes clinical data, such as survey, patient interview, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and brain imaging, in addition to a genome/protein index, in integrated manner, finally creating a diagnostic index.\n",
      "The third analysis is risk evaluation analysis.\n",
      "When risk factors highly relevant to IA are determined by integrated analysis of genome data, it generates an algorithm to provide a risk evaluation score for the respective factor.\n",
      "In this study, the contents of genome analyses are not described, because they are separate areas of study.\n",
      "Because IABio service model proposed in our study can ensure safe access to information entered by users and can provide integrated data analysis service.\n",

      "In this study, the IUA guideline [5] and OAuth 2.0 [6] are used to design and realize IABio.\n",
      "Researchers should obtain access authorization to use IABio and the concerned data.\n",
      "The server manager who controls the authorization server should not have access to the database in which patient information is saved.\n",
      "Therefore, the IABio server should be physically separated from the authorization server and provide only authorization and authority.\n",
      "This kind of environment is suitable for the IUA guideline.\n",
      "In this study, the authorization method uses the OAuth 2.0-based ROPCG method and is designed in a communication diagram, as in Fig.4.\n",
      "Our study proposes an authorization method based on the 2-step access authorization of IABio, along with resource owner server (web portal) authorization.\n",
      "Each researcher (client) should be assigned an authorization token from the authorization server to get access to the portal.\n",
      "After obtaining the authorization token, the researcher has access to the portal and proceeds with the first authorization.\n",
      "Next, the researcher gets the second authorization in IABio to use the service.\n",
      "Because security authorization is strictly designed in double walls, it can avoid weaknesses to phishing scams and impersonation attacks.\n",
      "The first step of the authorization procedure is to check if it is possible to identify users' personal information.\n",
      "The second authorization step proceeds with authorization for database access one more time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fig.5 shows the system environment in which the IABio system is composed with OAuth 2.0 of a medical information standard environment.\n",

      "Two servers are used: IABio server and authorization server.\n",
      "HP ProLiant Micro Server Gen8 is used to design the IABio database, and it consists of 1TB SSD, 2TB HDD, and 12GB RAM.\n",
      "To compose the development environment, Apache 2.2 is used as server software to configure the Tomcat Server.\n",
      "For the web service, PHP 5.2 is used to supplement the functions of existing HTTP language.\n",
      "MySQL 5.1 is used to compose the Tomcat server and PHP, which can interwork with the database.\n",
      "APM (Apache, PHP, MySQL) is mutually complementary and flexible for interworking.\n",
      "Furthermore, it is compatible with all operating systems, such as Unix, Linux, and Windows.\n",
      "The authorization server uses Naver application programming interface (API), which supports OAuth 2.0 [12].\n",
      "Since Naver API provides a security server in itself, it is cost-effective.\n",
      "In addition, it is possible to customize so as to receive an authorization token by using Naver ID.\n",
      "Currently, most domestic web service providers related to authorization use OAuth 2.0 of Naver API.\n",
      "Therefore, it can ensure security.\n",
      "JSON method is employed for the exchange of messages between a portal and database server and authorization server.\n",
      "The JSON method enables message exchange with shorter codes than the existing Extensible Markup Language (XML) method.\n",
      "Therefore, it is faster in speed and can reduce load.\n",
      "For security protocol, IUA guidelines and OAuth 2.0 are used.\n",
      "PHP 2.2 is used to realize OAuth 2.0.\n",

      "It can support interworking between data.\n",
      "Therefore, data integration is possible.\n",

      "Following the gene prediction of these genomes using GeneMark, a protein domain search for \"Retron-type reverse transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, transposons)\" using RPS-BLAST resulted in 16,844 candidate retron sequences.\n",
      "Alternatively, filtering out nonretron-type reverse transcriptase sequences can be also achieved by extracting protein sequences from the RefSeq annotation, followed by the domain search.\n",
      "Instead, we chose to predict genes from the genome sequences using GeneMark, followed by the domain search.\n",

      "Title: Automatic filtration of candidate msDNA sequences\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidate retron sequences identified above were filtered by the presence of palindrome motifs.\n",
      "Using the local python script, we searched the 16,844 bacterial sequences for palindrome motifs 5–10-bp-long and separated by less than 200 bp within 2 kb upstream of ret, yielding 7,428,332 such hits.\n",
      "These hits were then screened by the HMM models that were developed based on the prototype msDNA sequences.\n",
      "There were 3,865 hits surpassing the crossvalidation threshold of 45.0.\n",
      "Using a local installation of CentroidFold, the RNA secondary structures were predicted for the remaining hits, and those without the proper double-strand pairing between the 5' and 3' ends were removed.\n",
      "Furthermore, those without the conserved flanking G residues were also filtered out.\n",
      "The whole process, which was wrapped in a Linux shell script, resulted in 625 hits.\n",
      "Title: Manual curation and clustering of msDNA sequences\n",
      "\n",
      "The final set of 625 candidate sequences that were identified by an automatic process was highly redundant.\n",
      "The exact copies were pruned, giving rising to a set of 88 unique sequence types.\n",
      "As shown in Fig.1A, the true msDNA should possess two hairpins in msr and a long hairpin in the msd region.\n",
      "In order to confirm this complex overall topology of msDNA, we examined the RNA secondary structure plots of the 88 candidates visually.\n",
      "In fact, we removed 40 sequences that did not form the appropriate overall topology.\n",
      "See Fig.3 for a few representative surviving examples.\n",
      "Among the original 625 sequences, 525 can be mapped to these 48 unique sequence types (Supplementary Table 1).\n",
      "In order to cluster the remaining 48 sequence types further, allowing small divergences within clusters, multiple-sequence alignment was performed with Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT) [10].\n",
      "From the resulting dendrogram, we recognized 20 groups by splitting the tree at a branch length of between 0.12 and 0.20 (Fig.4).\n",
      "The species distribution of the 525 msDNA sequences over the 20 groups is given in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1.\n",
      "We developed a rule-based protocol to detect msDNA in a given genomic DNA sequence.\n",
      "The rule is based on the presence of a 5–10-bp-long palindrome motif in the precursor transcript that is less than 2 kb upstream of a retron-type reverse transcriptase gene.\n",
      "The rule is augmented by enforcing a sequence similarity with known msDNA sequences.\n",
      "This step is implemented with an HMM profile search method.\n",
      "While this was a powerful filtration step, reducing the hits by about 1/20, it would inevitably miss some true msDNA sequences that are distantly related to the prototypes given in Table 1.\n",
      "As more distinct msDNA sequences are discovered, the panel of the seed sequences must be updated.\n",
      "The list of potential candidate msDNA sequences was filtered by conformation to the known topology of the RNA secondary structure.\n",
      "The RNA secondary structure prediction programs usually output the result in terms of Vienna dot bracket notation [9].\n",
      "As the manipulation of the string is not straightforward, some manual curation was involved.\n",
      "In the future, we will explore the possibility of automatic implementation, which is critical for web-based service of the prediction tool.\n",
      "To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale annotation of msDNA in all publically available bacterial genome sequences.\n",
      "As our work is computational in nature, the list we compiled can include some false positives.\n",
      "Its authenticity should be validated experimentally.\n",

      "While a normal male inherits an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and a normal female inherits two X chromosomes, several abnormalities in the number of sex chromosomes occur gender-specifically.\n",
      "For females, abnormalities are a result of variations in the number of X chromosomes.\n",

      "The most frequent sex chromosome abnormalities in females are Turner (one X; 1:2,000) and triple X (XXX; 1:1,000), while those in males are Klinefelter (XXY; 1:500) and XYY (1:1,000) syndromes [12131415].\n",
      "For comparison, we collected Infinium 450K Human-Methylation array data of one Turner syndrome patient and five Klinefelter syndrome patients.\n",
      "The characteristic methylation pattern of Turner syndrome (one X) is the hypomethylation of both X- and Y-specific markers (Fig.3A).\n",
      "However, we found that most discordant-female samples in our dataset showed hypermethylation patterns in Y-specific markers, suggesting that they had XY chromosomes (a normal male) but not X (Turner syndrome) chromosome (Fig.3A).\n",
      "Only one discordant-female sample (green circle in Fig.2A) showed a pattern similar to Turner syndrome.\n",
      "For Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), the expected methylation patterns are the hypermethylation of both male- and female-specific markers.\n",
      "We observed one discordant-male sample in which both male- and female-specific markers were hypermethylated (red circles in Figs.2B and 3A).\n",
      "However, a close examination of three Klinefelter syndrome-specific markers revealed that the one discordant-male sample did not show the patterns of a Klinefelter syndrome patient (Fig.3B, Supplementary Fig.4) [16].\n",

      "Because the datasets we analyzed had age information, as well, we tested whether the given age information deviated much from the estimated age from age-specific DNA methylation markers.\n",
      "The age prediction was performed by using the DNA methylation age calculator, a web-based tool that provides a predicted age based on the methylation values of DNA methylation markers of Illumina's Infinium platform [18].\n",
      "When we compared the absolute age deviation between concordant and discordant samples, we found much larger deviations in age prediction among discordant samples compared with concordant samples (Table 1, Supplementary Fig.5).\n",
      "This result suggests that the discordant samples are highly likely to have errors both in age and gender information, a scenario that occurs when two samples are mislabeled as each other.\n",

      "To see if the same problem occurs in other types of data (e.g., gene expression), we collected gene expression microarray data from the NCBI GEO database using a similar strategy for methylation microarray data (Fig.4).\n",
      "By applying the same criteria as with the DNA methylation data, we collected a total of 1,683 samples from 4 datasets produced using the Affymetrix U133Plus2 array platform (Table 2).\n",
      "We analyzed the 1,683 samples using several gender-specific genes (X (inactive)-specific transcript [XIST], eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, Y-linked [EIF1AY], and DEAD [Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp] box polypeptide 3, Y-linked [DDDX3Y]) [10] and found that 40 samples (2.3%) from 3 datasets were erroneously described (Fig.5).\n",
      "In the case of Y chromosome markers, some discordant male samples showed overlapping distribution of methylation levels compared with normal male samples.\n",
      "Those samples needed to be compared samples with male sex abnormality syndromes (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome), but unfortunately, we could not find datasets with male sex abnormality syndromes produced using the same platform.\n",
      "However, as these samples showed the opposite pattern in X chromosome markers, we considered them to be putative discordant samples.\n",
      "But, further validation will be needed to confirm these samples.\n",
      "Unlike the previous methylation data, some of the collected gene expression datasets contained technical replicates of the same samples (Table 2).\n",
      "Surprisingly, discordant gender-specific expression patterns were even observed from some of the technically replicated samples (Supplementary Fig.6).\n",
      "Recently, genomewide omics data have accumulated very fast due to advances in omics technologies (e.g., Illumina's Infinium methylation assay and next-generation sequencing).\n",
      "Now, researchers can exploit public data repositories (e.g., ArrayExpress [3] and GEO [2]) that store data of hundreds of thousands of samples with both genomewide profiling data and associated clinical information.\n",
      "However, as we have shown here, datasets are not error-free, and any type of error can occur in public datasets.\n",
      "Indeed, one paper reported that the aggregate mislabeled blood sample rate was 1.12% at various US institutions in 2013 [19].\n",
      "Possibly, various kinds of errors (e.g., mislabeling of tubes, mixing of samples) may occur from sample preparation to various steps of the experimental procedures.\n",
      "When we began the analysis of Infinium 450K Human-Methylation array data, we did not expect errors in gender description to occur so often in several datasets.\n",
      "We thus analyzed if those erroneous samples showed the methylation patterns of gender-specific chromosome abnormality syndromes (e.g., Turner and Klinefelter syndromes) but found that most of the erroneous samples did not.\n",
      "Thus, we concluded that most discordant samples were real human errors.\n",
      "This finding led us to analyze expression datasets of Affymetrix U133Plus2 array data, as well, and again, we found that errors were not rare as well.\n",
      "Fortunately, for transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets, gender-specific markers (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) are well known, so that researchers can check whether the given gender information is concordant with the expected patterns of gender-specific markers.\n",
      "For DNA methylation, a user-friendly website (https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/) [18] is also available for researchers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique was adopted into clinical practices, revolutionary advances in diagnosing rare genetic diseases have been achieved through translating genomic medicine into precision or personalized management.\n",
      "Indeed, several successful cases of molecular diagnosis and treatment with personalized or targeted therapies of rare genetic diseases have been reported.\n",
      "Still, there are several obstacles to be overcome for wider application of NGS-based precision medicine, including high sequencing cost, incomplete variant sensitivity and accuracy, practical complexities, and a shortage of available treatment options.\n",
      "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has achieved great advances in medicine and clinical practice, as well as in basic research field.\n",
      "NGS-based precision medicine has mainly focused on cancer [12], given the prevalence, availability of drugs targeting major oncogenic factors, and impact on human health.\n",
      "Another sector of focus through NGS-based precision medicine is ultra-rare diseases.\n",
      "Ultra-rare diseases can be defined as disorders that occur with a prevalence of below 1 in 2,000,000, although this frequency cutoff can be flexible [3].\n",
      "Usually, rare disease research is performed with large families for traits with dominant inheritance [45] or patient-parent trios for spontaneous cases [6].\n",
      "Discovery of causative genetic variants using whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) should be followed by in vitro or in vivo model functional studies to fully explain the molecular basis of the diseases and confirm the functionality of the variants [4567].\n",
      "It is presumed that a large portion of ultra-rare diseases are caused by de novo mutations occurring at functionally important protein coding regions (Fig.1) [8 9].\n",
      "Every human zygote is expected to have approximately 70–80 de novo mutations in its genome, and this poses a small chance to have ultra-rare diseases, depending on the position where the de novo mutations lie [810].\n",
      "Since NGS was adopted into medical genetics, the number of rare disease-causing gene discoveries has been increasing rapidly, and the genetics of many idiopathic diseases have been elucidated [111213].\n",
      "In this review, we present the perspectives gained from recent studies on ultra-rare diseases diagnosed by NGS and successful treatments and discuss the potential obstacles for wider application of NGS-based precision medicine.\n",
      "Although cystic fibrosis is not an ultra-rare disease by definition, it presents a good example of precision medicine.\n",
      "Typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, patients carry two non-functional alleles of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).\n",
      "Recently, an NGS-based diagnostic assay to detect mutations in CFTR was authorized for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [14].\n",

      "Prenatal screening and prediction of ultra-rare disease with NGS are not widely used yet due to their cost and efficacy.\n",
      "But, if the parents of a child with an ultra-rare disease who was diagnosed by NGS plan to have another child, prenatal testing with DNA extracted from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is possible.\n",
      "If the cost of NGS declines, screening of rare genetic diseases with NGS might be routinely performed.\n",
      "At this moment, a non-invasive prenatal test using NGS is rapidly being introduced to the clinical field, which allows the detection of fetal aneuploidies, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) [22].\n",
      "This technique uses cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in maternal circulation and enables non-invasive liquid biopsy, in contrast to invasive procedures, including amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling.\n",
      "Although it is technically challenging to detect small nucleotide-level mutations from cffDNA at the present time, extensive research in this field has yielded potential in tackling the problem [23].\n",
      "Despite these encouraging cases, there are wide gaps between the diagnosis and treatment of ultra-rare diseases.\n",
      "Targeted and tailored therapies for ultra-rare diseases are usually hard, mainly because of scarce treatment options.\n",
      "To fill these gaps, several conditions should be fulfilled.\n",
      "First, the cost of NGS should decrease further.\n",
      "As of this writing, the cost of WES has fallen to under USD $1,000, which is still a formidable price for a routine application in clinics, while the usage of WGS may still be impractical.\n",
      "Second, the sensitivity and specificity of genetic diagnostics should be improved.\n",
      "Current commercially available exome capture kits covers ~99% of the RefSeq exome, and over 95% of the targeted bases are covered at least eight times with a typical WES run [24], implying that we are achieving fair exome coverage technically.\n",
      "However, the positive diagnostic rate of clinical WES for Mendelian phenotypes remains ~30% [25], suggesting that a substantial portion of the remainder (~70%) might be caused by variants located outside of exons or are not detectable by WES.\n",
      "Although the majority of functionally critical and disease-causing mutations occurs in protein-coding regions, the vast majority of the genome is non-coding and may contain variants with functional significance that has been neglected.\n",
      "Third, processes of NGS data generation should be more simplified.\n",
      "Currently, the typical NGS pipeline consists of library preparation, sequencing, and multiple analysis steps, including read alignments, variant calling, and annotation.\n",
      "For NGS to pervade in clinical practice, the processes from DNA samples to the final results should be more concise.\n",
      "In this context, nanopore sequencing techniques, such as MinION, could function as a good alternative to current NGS technologies if they improve the high error rates and relatively small-scale data output [26].\n",
      "Fourth, more treatment options, such as targeted drugs and gene therapy strategies, should be provided.\n",
      "The metastatic rhabdoid meningioma with a BRAF mutation and CTLA-4 cases mentioned above are rather exceptional cases, since the genetic alterations were already targeted through commercially available drugs.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the CTLA-4 case is a good example of drug repositioning, which can be an efficient option to accelerate treatments for ultra-rare diseases, given its shorter development time and lower cost [27].\n",
      "Although they are given less clinical attention and researched less often, ultra-rare diseases have been occurring constantly, because every new baby will have de novo mutations in its genome, posing a small chance of the mutations causing an unseen phenotype.\n",
      "Thus, it would be important to improve prompt and accurate diagnoses and suggest appropriate treatment options for ultra-rare disease patients.\n",
      "Although we still face many technical difficulties to address—such as the high price of NGS, imperfect NGS technology, practical complexities, and a shortage of treatment options—the several cases illustrated here demonstrate successful application of NGS-based precision medicine for ultra-rare diseases, benefiting patient care in the long term.\n",
      "In the near future, NGS will be an essential component in precision medicine regarding its high throughput and relatively low and further decreasing cost and the importance of individual genomic information for personalized strategies.\n",

      "In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation data on colon cancer taken from The Caner Genome Atlas.\n",
      "We found that several promoters were significantly hypermethylated in colon cancer patients.\n",
      "Through clustering analysis of differentially methylated DNA regions, we were able to define subgroups of patients and observed clinical features associated with each subgroup.\n",
      "In addition, we analyzed the functional ontology of aberrantly methylated genes and identified the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway as one of the major pathways affected epigenetically.\n",
      "In conclusion, our analysis shows the possibility of characterizing the clinical features of colon cancer subgroups based on DNA methylation patterns and provides lists of important genes and pathways possibly involved in colon cancer development.\n",
      "Generally, it is known that cancer is a result of somatic mutations in DNA.\n",
      "These mutations are located in genes that have important roles in regulating cell growth, cell differentiation, and DNA damage control [12].\n",
      "Over the past decades, many cancer driver genes have been found by high-throughput sequencing technology, and thus, the number of cancer driver genes may have reached the limit [13].\n",
      "Until now, many researchers have studied the mechanism of carcinogenesis and highlighted the biological role of driver mutations, such as TP53, PIK3CA, and KRAS [4].\n",
      "However, in many types of cancers, the etiology of cancer cannot be explained only by DNA mutations.\n",
      "Researchers have found that epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, also contribute to cancer formation and development [5].\n",
      "Epigenetic factors are dynamic modifications that can change the state of gene expression or regulate expression rates.\n",
      "Some studies have shown that a large group of cancer patients have both globally low and high levels of DNA methylation (hypomethylation and hypermethylation, respectively) in specific promoter regions [6].\n",
      "Based on analysis of DNA methylation data, they listed a few cancer-related genes that carry significant methylation changes as biomarkers [7].\n",
      "However, the biological meaning of these markers is still not well known.\n",
      "Hence, in this study, we used colon cancer (COAD) datasets taken from The Caner Genome Atlas (TCGA) to observe a CG dense region called CpG islands (CGIs) that showed significant aberrations in DNA methylation and also analyzed changes in DNA methylation patterns to further understand the relationship between epigenetic changes and cancer mechanism.\n",

      "To focus on the effect of promoter CGIs, we selected CGIs that fell only into our defined promoter region, which covers the transcription start site ± 1 kb.\n",
      "Using this boundary, a total of 15,966 promoter CGIs were counted.\n",
      "The methylation distribution pattern of promoter CGIs was plotted by taking the mean promoter CGI methylation from the entire tumor and normal sample datasets.\n",
      "To get differentially methylated promoter CGIs, the averaged normal data were used as a reference, since there were no significant variations among normal samples.\n",
      "Differential patient data were calculated by subtracting this reference from each patient methylation data point (n = 297).\n",
      "In order to define the differential methylation cutoff, we referred to the methylation distribution pattern between normal samples and tumors.\n",
      "Methylated CGI annotated genes varied in their methylation percentage throughout the patients.\n",
      "Therefore, differentially methylated CGIs were identified as absolute difference of 0.3 in beta-values in at least 30% of total patients to obtain a broader range for gene selection (Fig.1).\n",
      "We grouped COAD patients by clustering their CGI differential methylation values using Cluster3.0 (http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm).\n",

      "We then derived differential DNA methylation values between tumor and averaged normal samples.\n",
      "Differential methylation values of single-base probes were averaged by individual CGIs, and the data were filtered to indicate CGIs with significant changes in methylation as described in the \"Methods\" section (Fig.1).\n",
      "We also checked the distribution of DNA methylation within promoter CGIs between normal and tumor samples by taking the mean of each condition per CGI.\n",
      "We observed that in general, promoter CGIs were hypermethylated in COAD patients in comparison to those in normal samples (Fig.2A).\n",
      "We went on to group COAD patients based on their differential methylation status in promoter CGIs using clustering analysis.\n",
      "Since it is rare to see promoter CGIs being differentially methylated across an entire group of patients, clustering was focused on selecting CGIs, as well as identifying patient groups, based on their differential methylation patterns.\n",
      "From our results, we observed a greater number of hypermethylated CGIs than hypomethylated CGIs (Fig.2B).\n",
      "As indicated by previous studies, COAD follows a common methylation pattern in cancer, which is hypermethylation of promoter CGIs [9].\n",
      "We were also able to distinguish three distinctive clustered groups by their differential methylation patterns.\n",
      "Group 2 (n = 76) showed a much higher level of methylation within selected CGIs than groups 1 and 3.\n",
      "Group 1 showed intermediate differential methylation.\n",
      "To find the meaning of each classified patient group, we investigated their respective clinical data (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).\n",
      "When we analyzed the groups by clinical category, such as race, age, gender, and tumor stage, we could not find any discriminating factor among the three groups.\n",
      "However, we observed a distinct rate of metastasis in group 2, which showed the highest level of hypermethylation.\n",
      "At the same time, group 2 showed a higher rate of microsatellite instability (MSI).\n",
      "MSI is a hypermutable phenotype caused by impaired DNA mismatch repair.\n",
      "It is already known that MSI is associated with hypermethylation in the promoter region of the MLH1 gene [10].\n",
      "Although the MLH1 gene was not detected in our filtered data, we surmised that the MSI phenotype in COAD patients can be affected by both DNA hypermethylation and MLH1 gene activity itself.\n",
      "Interestingly, the tumor sites differed among the three groups.\n",
      "In group 2, the cecum was the most frequent tumor site, while the sigmoid colon was the least frequent site in comparison with groups 1 and 3.\n",
      "These results provide a few insights about epigenetic mechanisms in COAD.\n",
      "First, the varying methylation patterns across COAD patient groups imply distinctive epigenetic cancer mechanisms pertaining to different patient groups.\n",
      "This could lead to subtyping COAD with varying promoter CGI methylation status, which can be utilized for treatment in patients.\n",
      "Second, hypermethylated promoter CGIs were enriched in differentially methylated region, which implies that the mechanism for COAD in promoter CGIs might be driven predominantly by methylating factors, such as DNA methyltransferases.\n",

      "We further selected datasets that had both normal and tumor samples from identical patients (n = 26).\n",
      "Since we expected different gene expression levels within the divided groups, we averaged the expression level of patients by each group.\n",
      "We then compared the mean values of promoter-overlapping genes between the groups to see the general expression level (Fig.3).\n",
      "It is well known that the effect of promoter CGI methylation is repression of gene expression.\n",
      "We observed that group 2 experienced the highest repression of gene expression levels, thus reflecting the role of promoter CGI methylation as a gene-repressive marker.\n",
      "In comparison, we noted the highest overall gene expression levels in group 3.\n",
      "COAD patients in less hypermethylated groups, however, were less affected by hypermethylation in their promoter region.\n",
      "We noted that there were some patients in all groups whose gene expression was not affected by methylation.\n",
      "We assumed that there were not only epigenetic factors but many other varying factors among cancer patients that could result in regulation at individual genes.\n",
      "This DNA methylation change in promoter CGIs, which alters gene expression, is called epi-mutation [11].\n",
      "Using this analogy, some patients were epi-mutated in aberrantly methylated promoter CGIs, while others were not affected significantly.\n",
      "In general, we were able to see that promoter CGI hypermethylation is mostly linked to the overall repression of gene expression, confirming the epi-mutation effect.\n",
      "Title: Epi-mutated genes and pathways in COAD\n",
      "\n",
      "To see the biological function of hypermethylated promoter CGI genes, we performed gene ontology analysis [8].\n",
      "Gene ontology analysis provides a functional interpretation of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component among selected genes.\n",
      "The ontology results included mainly neural development-related terms, such as synaptic transmission and nervous system development (Table 2).\n",
      "Interestingly, the gene ontology term of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor activity was found.\n",
      "This implies that a large group of downstream genes that are targeted by the affected transcription factors could have a potential role in cancer initiation and development.\n",
      "Additionally, we carried out pathway analysis to further understand cancer-related biological processes affected by epi-mutated genes (Supplementary Table 2).\n",
      "In fact, many recent cancer-related pathways are found with mutations among patients, and this information is useful for functional studies of cancer mechanisms [2].\n",
      "We attempted to provide an extended network that involves hypermethylated promoter CGI genes to expand our understanding of epi-mutational pathways in cancer.\n",
      "Selected pathways with p-value <0.05 include Wnt signaling, the RAS pathway, migration and invasion, extracellular matrix organization, and cell adhesion.\n",
      "These pathways are commonly related to cancer proliferation and metastasis [12].\n",
      "In addition to the pathways previously mentioned, we found the following pathways to be distinctive to only hypermethylated promoter CGI genes in COAD: calcium signaling, ion channel, and GPCR signaling; especially interesting is the observation of hypermethylation in many ligands and receptors that are involved in GPCR signaling (Fig.4) [1314151617181920].\n",
      "This implies that epigenetic mechanisms play a role upstream of the pathway, regulating many downstream signaling pathways that are involved in cancer growth.\n",
      "Epi-mutated pathway analysis thus allows us to find additional cancer-related pathways that have not been previously highlighted by analyses based on somatic mutations.\n",
      "Overall, these results suggest the function of hypermethylation in promoter CGI genes in colon cancer as a driver of transcriptional regulation and developmental events and indicate that epi-mutated genes are involved in regulating various cancer-related pathways, like GPCR signaling, in favor of colon cancer development.\n",
      "In contrast to somatic mutations, epigenetic changes are reversible phenomena.\n",
      "Using this property, epigenetic factors can be therapeutic targets of cancer treatments.\n",
      "Until now, DNA methylation inhibitors, such as azacitidine, have been used as one of many cancer drugs.\n",
      "However, this kind of drug is not able to specify the target molecule and shows differential drug effects in individual cancer patients.\n",
      "In this paper, we observed impaired DNA methylation in colon cancer patients—so-called epi-mutation [21].\n",
      "We can confirm that DNA methylation aberrations in specific promoter regions were widely distributed in cancer patients and that patient groups can be divided by the extent of DNA methylation change.\n",
      "We expect that by introducing the epi-mutation concept, patients of a certain cancer type that is not explained by somatic mutations can be diagnosed more sensitively.\n",
      "Moreover, the subgroups of patients will provide a clue for the different drug effects between individual cancer patients.\n",
      "Further epi-mutation studies in each cancer type will define cancer-specific related biological pathways, and overall, these results will help us understand the cancer mechanisms and develop target-specific cancer drugs.\n",

      "T. gondii invades the host cell by forming a moving junction (MJ) complex.\n",
      "This complex formation is initiated by intermolecular interactions between the two secretory parasitic proteins—namely, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) and is critically essential for the host invasion process.\n",
      "By this study, we propose two potential leads, NSC95522 and NSC179676 that can efficiently target the AMA1 hydrophobic cleft, which is a hotspot for targeting MJ complex formation.\n",

      "The hydrophobic cleft region of AMA1 is documented to play a predominant role in facilitating the binding of RON2 to AMA1 and is also reinforced by recent crystallographic studies on AMA1-RON2 complex formation [10].\n",
      "Moreover, this region is found to be highly conserved across the diverse family of AMA1 proteins and is surrounded by polymorphic flexible loops.\n",
      "These loops are speculated to preclude the host antibody response and has also been found to guard the conserved sites in AMA1 [11].\n",
      "The hydrophobic cleft is found to span within domain I of AMA1 and forms a binding pocket that receives the critical loop region of RON2 due to its accommodative shape and charge complementarity.\n",
      "The hydrophobic cleft region of AMA1 includes 15 residues (Val142, Leu155, Ile161, Phe163, Ile171, Phe174, Leu179, Ile185, Phe197, Met203, Tyr230, Val231, Trp253, Trp353, and Trp354) [12].\n",
      "Recent studies illustrate that RON2 displaces a loop in domain II of AMA1, thereby exposing its binding surface, enabling the RON2 loop to penetrate deep into the hydrophobic groove of AMA1 and hence forming a stable complex during host invasion [13].\n",
      "A recent study also showed that an oligopeptide binds across the full length of the AMA1 hydrophobic cleft to prevent AMA1-RON2 complex formation and eventually blocks parasitic host invasion [1415].\n",
      "Hence, the hydrophobic cleft and its surrounding loops, which include the cysteine loop region and coil connector, have been proposed to be a critical hotspot to block AMA1-RON2 complex formation.\n",
      "To date, there is a paucity of data on small molecules targeting these interactions.\n",
      "Hence, in this study, the coordinates of the crystal structure complex depicting these interactions (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 2Y8T, AMA1 interacting with a surface-exposed region of RON2) [16] were subjected to an exhaustive, multilevel precision high-throughput virtual screen (HTVS) of ligands from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) database with 250,000 compounds to identify leads that potentially disrupt these interactions.\n",

      "Furthermore, optimization of the protein structure was also performed by adjusting the terminal chi rotation of asparagine, glutamine, and histidine residues.\n",

      "Scoring functions play a major role in the docking process for identifying plausible ligand binding poses and also for ranking the binding affinity.\n",
      "Among the top 10 compounds, NSC95522, NSC88253, NSC13604, and NSC179676 (Table 1, Supplementary Fig.1) were found to be highly significant in collective terms of XP Glide score, PASS prediction, formation of intermolecular H-bonds, and π-cation interactions with the critical hydrophobic cleft residues, as well as in the cysteine loop region.\n",

      "Tyr230 is a vital residue in the hydrophobic cleft, as it is the central tyrosine of the apical groove and is mandatory for RON2 binding and also in the formation of a contiguous surface, which is critical for MJ assembly [30].\n",
      "Ser232 is also documented in Plasmodium falciparum as a key hotspot residue, as it occupies the hydrophobic cleft-spanning region [31].\n",
      "Tyr213 and Tyr215 are also crucial, as these residues are key facilitators of conformational changes in AMA1 DII loop displacement towards exposing a clear pocket to which Pro1309 of RON2 docks to the triad of tyrosine residues (Tyr110/142, Tyr213/234, and Tyr215/236) during AMA1-RON2 interactions [32].\n",

      "Met204 is a key residue for AMA1 targeting, as it is present in the cysteine loop region, which is also a critical substructure for AMA1-RON2 complex formation.\n",
      "As per previous studies, disruption of the cysteine loop is found to exhibit inefficiency in domain-II loop displacement [17].\n",
      "PASS predicted this compound to be antiprotozoal and may prove it to be efficient in targeting toxoplasmosis and also other apicomplexans.\n",

      "As discussed earlier, flexibility of these residues is crucial for homing RON2.\n",
      "However, the other two compounds did not show this impact (Fig.3A and 3B).\n",
      "Moreover, the Rg for both apo and all 4 holo forms was found to be within an admissible deviation of <1 Å. NSC95522 and NSC179676 showed the lowest Rg deviation of 0.44 Å and 0.53 Å, while the apo form showed 0.57 Å; thus, this reinforces that these two compounds confer backbone rigidity and compactness, which strongly preclude RON2 binding (Fig.3C).\n",
      "Secondary structure element (SSE) perturbations were also analyzed in a similar way as discussed above.\n",
      "This inferred no major dynamism in the SSE during the entire production run; it also corroborated with the fewest changes observed in the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds formed for the apo and all other 4 holo forms (Fig.3D).\n",
      "For all four of these compounds, the stability of protein-ligand contacts during the production run was analyzed and visualized as a 2D interaction map (Fig.4A–D).\n",

      "Recent studies propose that ligands exhibiting π-cation interactions with Phe, Tyr, and Trp of the receptor highly influence the conformational stability of the proteins, as they are strong non-covalent electrostatic interactions [3435].\n",
      "A holistic and stringent comparative analysis was performed over the 4 holo forms against the apo form, which strongly reinforces that AMA1-NSC95522 and AMA1-NSC179676 are stable complexes.\n",
      "Moreover, both these compounds exhibit prominent π-cation interactions with the proven hotspot residues Tyr213, Tyr230, Tyr110, and Tyr215 of AMA1 for ~80% of the entire production run, implying that these compounds are potential blockers of conformational changes of AMA1, which facilitates the binding of RON2 [35].\n",
      "The MMGBSA scores of the AMA1-NSC95522 and AMA1-NSC179676 complexes were found to be -79 kcal/mol and -59 kcal/mol respectively, also ensuring significant binding and stable complex formation [20].\n",
      "In conclusion, NSC95522 and NSC179676 shall be considered the most potential leads, with both showing significant binding free energies with strong intermolecular interactions to hydrophobic cleft residues.\n",
      "Moreover, these compounds were also found to limit the torsion angle of the AMA1 tilt of 90°, while the other two compounds showed a wide range of deviation (~90° to 180°).\n",
      "Hence, all of these inferences strongly suggest that NSC95522 and NSC179676, with antiprotozoal and ophthalmic activity, shall prove to be highly efficient leads for targeting AMA1-RON2 interactions (Fig.4E), thereby combating toxoplasmosis.\n",

      "Examination of genomic location revealed that rs17124500, which was the polymorphic nucleotide most closely associated with LS-BMD, is generally detected in potassium channel, subfamily K, member 1 (KCNK10) in 14q31.3 (Fig.1A).\n",
      "Rs34594869 and rs17124504, were observed upstream of regions with high linkage disequilibrium constants, defined here as D' >0.8.\n",
      "Rs140155614 was most prominent in the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase domain containing 1 (AGPHD1) locus 15q25.1 (Fig.1B).\n",
      "All four of these SNPs occurred as intron variants.\n",
      "rs111822233, the only sequence to influence the mineral density of the femur total, was positioned around the nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 2 (NR3C2) in 4q31.1 (Fig.1C).\n",
      "The function of this SNP is currently undetermined.\n",
      "In addition to establishing links between genetic polymorphisms and BMD, our studies aimed to identify loci previously confirmed as osteoporosis factors in Korean male populations in order to verify our outcomes (Table 3).\n",
      "Rs61382873 in LRP5 exhibited the highest association with LS-BMD (p = 0.0009).\n",
      "Rs9567003 (p = 0.0033) in TNFSF11 and rs9935828 (p = 0.0248) in FOXL1 were also linked to the lumbar spine region, albeit with higher p-values.\n",

      "We identified five SNPs and three genomic regions, associated with BMD.\n",
      "Four of these SNPs (rs17124500, rs34594869, rs17124504, and rs140155614) were linked with LS-BMD and dispersed between two loci (14q31.1 and 15q25.1).\n",
      "One SNP (rs111822233) found in 4q31.1 was exclusively associated with FT-BMD.\n",
      "We also re-evaluated three previously established genetic relationships.\n",
      "First, we confirmed the connection between LS-BMD and the following loci: rs61382873 in LRP5, rs9567003 in TNFSF11, and rs9935828 in FOXL1.\n",
      "Next, we linked rs33997547 in ZBTB40 and rs1664496 in MEF2C with FT-BMD and analyzed rs61769193 expression patterns in FN-BMD.\n",
      "Three of our significant markers—rs17124500, rs34594869, and rs17124504—were located on the KCNK10 gene.\n",
      "This channel protein, embedded in the cellular membrane, consists of two pore-forming P domains and regulates K+ concentration.\n",
      "The role of potassium ions in maintaining the acid-base homeostasis of most organs and tissues, including bones, has been well established in the literature [25].\n",
      "Additionally, KCNK10 is located on 14q31, a locus previously associated with LS-BMD in linkage analyses [26].\n",
      "Although the relationship between the gene and osseous metabolism is not clear, it is highly possible that its translational mechanisms influence bone biological parameters.\n",
      "rs140155614 was prominent in the AGPHD1 domain.\n",
      "Alternatively known as hydroxylysine kinase (HYKK), this protein-coding gene and its associated pathway, catalyze the GTP-dependent phosphorylation of 5-hydroxy-L-lysine.\n",
      "Located on 15q25.1, it has a well-known connection to the development of lung cancer.\n",
      "CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4, a gene complex near AGPHD1, has been linked to nicotine dependence in several genetic studies [27].\n",
      "Current scientific evidence is insufficient in determining the role of this locus in BMD development 's replication patterns is needed to validate or dispute a relationship with BMD.\n",
      "rs111822233 was the only genetic marker with a direct relationship to FT-BMD levels.\n",
      "Located on 4q31.1, it is near NR3C2, a nuclear receptor involved in steroid signaling and regulation.\n",
      "Mineralocorticoid and various sex hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, alternatively bind to the protein, which influences their secretion via a feedback loop [28].\n",
      "Bone resorption has been reported to increase with the withdrawal of these sex hormones.\n",
      "Although estrogen is the major steroid in regulating ossein metabolism, testosterone is also important in the resorption mechanism [29].\n",
      "Moreover, prevalence of osteoporosis in the hipbone has been shown to increase in men whose testosterone levels are lower than the reference range [30].\n",
      "As established in our introduction, research conducted with Korean participants tends to be inconclusive owing to extensive focus on replication of results obtained by the original GWASs.\n",
      "Thus, we attempted to bridge this gap in information by validating previously established genetic linkages in Caucasian populations, whose significance has been confirmed in Korean men by replication studies [1314].\n",
      "LRP5, MEF2C, and ZBTB40 belong to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is largely related to cellular development and growth.\n",
      "Several studies have observed a link between this cascade and BMD [31].\n",
      "We utilized a series of SNP markers from various Wnt-associated genes and were able to prove as association between rs61382873 in LRP5 and LS-BMD, between rs33997547 in ZBTB40 and rs1664496 in MEF2C and FT-BMD, and between rs61769193 in ZBTB40 and FN-BMD.\n",
      "TNFSF11, also known as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) plays a critical role in adequate bone metabolism via activation of osteoclast cells to regulate resorption [31].\n",
      "We identified a significant SNP marker in TNFSF11, rs9567003, which was related to LS-BMD.\n",
      "Our results were consistent with those of a previous genetic research, which has established a connection between TNFSF11 and BMD of the lumbar spinal cord [31].\n",
      "FOXL1 was originally identified by Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis (GEFOS) and has been associated with LS-BMD in European sample groups; this result has been replicated with high significance in Korean populations [13].\n",
      "Our marker in FOXL1, rs9935828, was also correlated with LS-BMD levels.\n",
      "In conclusion, we described a series of new loci and confirmed GWAS results in Korean male populations by working with skeletal-specific BMD and gene associations.\n",
      "There were several limitations to our study.\n",
      "First, no replications were performed to validate our results.\n",
      "Because indicators for measuring BMD in men tend to be narrow, recruiting a sufficient replication sample proved challenging.\n",
      "Thus, we aimed to use previously identified genetic markers, which have been established as valid in our selected ethnicity and gender.\n",
      "Despite our efforts, BMD is a less meaningful factor of osteoporosis in men than in women.\n",
      "Additionally, we could not consider all factors, including sex, age, weight, and menopausal status, owing to using only young men as our test subjects.\n",
      "Finally, we needed a very large sample because phenotypic variations are hard to detect in homogenous populations.\n",
      "However, our sample size was too small to employ a Bonferroni correction, and we were forced to set the significant threshold as p < 1 × 10-6, thus increasing the chance of false-positives.\n",
      "To minimize statistical error, we thoroughly analyzed gene functions and mechanisms.\n",
      "Nevertheless, further research is necessary to validate our findings.\n",
      "In conclusion, our study identified novel loci correlated with BMD at 14q31.3, 15q25.1, and 4q31.1 in Korean men.\n",
